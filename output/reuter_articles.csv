Half of the Senate's 348 seats were being contested.Le Pen's Rassemblement National had been widely expected to make a new breakthrough in the Senate but the score of three wins was above expectations.The election of far-right senators is mostly a delayed reflection of strong results by Le Pen's party in previous local elections and does not necessarily predict her results in the next elections.The only member of the French government running in the elections, Secretary of State for Citizenship Sonia Backes, was defeated in the French territory of New Caledonia.Under France's Fifth Republic, the Senate has less influence over legislating than the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament. In case of disagreement over legislation, it is the Assembly which has the last word.French President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party remains the biggest party in the lower house, but lost its majority in June last year, giving more weight to senators whenever a compromise is necessary with the upper house to pass legislation.Macron has struggled to anchor his party at a local level, with local authorities mostly controlled by France's historically dominant political forces, the conservative LR and the left-wing Socialist party.",https://www.reuters.com/article/france-politics/french-centre-right-keeps-control-of-senate-far-right-wins-3-seats-idUSKBN30U0E3
1,Armenian PM blames Russia for failing to ensure security | Reuters,"September 24, 2023",4:48 PM UTC,"MOSCOW, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said on Sunday the likelihood was rising that ethnic Armenians would flee the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh and blamed Russia for failing to ensure Armenian security.If 120,000 people go down the Lachin corridor to Armenia, the small South Caucasian country could face both a humanitarian and political crisis.""If proper conditions are not created for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their homes and there are no effective protection mechanisms against ethnic cleansing, the likelihood is rising that the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh will see exile from their homeland as the only way to save their lives and identity,"" Pashinyan said in address to the nation.""Responsibility for such a development of events will fall entirely on Azerbaijan, which adopted a policy of ethnic cleansing, and on the Russian peacekeeping contingent in Nagorno-Karabakh,"" he said, according to a government transcript.He added that the Armenian-Russian strategic partnership was ""not enough to ensure the external security of Armenia"".Last week, Azerbaijan scored a victory over ethnic Armenians who have controlled the Karabakh region since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. An adviser to the leader of the Karabakh Armenians told Reuters earlier on Sunday that the population would leave because they feel unsafe under Azerbaijani rule.Russia had acted as guarantor for a peace deal that ended a 44-day war in Karabakh three years ago, and many Armenians blame Moscow for failing to protect the region.Russian officials say Pashinyan is to blame for his own mishandling of the crisis, and have repeatedly said that Armenia, which borders Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan and Georgia, has few other friends in the region.""The government will accept our brothers and sisters from Nagorno-Karabakh with full care,"" Pashinyan said.Pashinyan has warned that some unidentified forces were seeking to stoke a coup against him and has accused Russian media of engaging in an information war against him.""Some of our partners are increasingly making efforts to expose our security vulnerabilities, putting at risk not only our external, but also internal security and stability, while violating all norms of etiquette and correctness in diplomatic and interstate relations, including obligations assumed under treaties,"" Pashinyan said in his Sunday address.""In this context, it is necessary to transform, complement and enrich the external and internal security instruments of the Republic of Armenia,"" he said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/armenia-azerbaijan-pashinyan/armenian-pm-says-armenians-may-flee-karabakh-and-blames-russia-idUSKBN30U03R
2,Canada House speaker apologizes for recognition of veteran who fought for Nazis | Reuters,"September 25, 2023",12:49 AM UTC,"WASHINGTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The speaker of Canada's House of Commons on Sunday apologized for praising an individual at a parliamentary meeting who served in a Nazi unit during World War Two.Two days earlier, Speaker Anthony Rota had recognized 98-year old Yaroslav Hunka as a ""Ukrainian hero"" before the Canadian Parliament. Hunka served in World War II as a member of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, according to the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights group that demanded an apology.Rota in a statement took responsibility for what was characterized as an oversight, calling the initiative ""entirely my own.""""I have subsequently become aware of more information which causes me to regret my decision,"" he said, adding his ""deepest apologies"" to Jewish communities.The recognition came following a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who thanked Canada for its assistance in his country's war against Russia.Following Zelenskiy's remarks, Rota acknowledged Hunka, who was seated in the gallery, praising him for fighting for Ukrainian independence against the Russians. Hunka received two standing ovations from those gathered.""At a time of rising antisemitism and Holocaust distortion, it is incredibly disturbing to see Canada's Parliament rise to applaud an individual who was a member of a unit in the Waffen-SS, a Nazi military branch responsible for the murder of Jews and others,"" the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center said in a statement while demanding an apology earlier Sunday.""An explanation must be provided as to how this individual entered the hallowed halls of Canadian Parliament and received recognition from the Speaker of the House and a standing ovation,"" the group added.Russia's RIA state news agency cited Russia's ambassador to Canada, Oleg Stepanov, as saying that the embassy will sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and a note to the Canadian foreign ministry on Monday.""We will, of course, demand clarification from the Canadian government,"" RIA cited Stepanov as saying.Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Ukraine in February 2022, saying the goal of the ""special military operation"" was to de-nazify and demilitarize its neighbour.Kyiv and its Western allies, say the aggression, which has since seen thousands killed and millions displaced, has been an unprovoked land grab. Washington has said that Moscow's false justification for the war has been nothing but the Kremlin's attempt to ""manipulate international public opinion.""Rota added in his statement that no one, including fellow parliamentarians or the Ukrainian delegation, was aware of his plans or remarks beforehand.Hunka could not be reached for comment.",https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-canada-zelenskiy/canada-house-speaker-apologizes-for-recognition-of-veteran-who-fought-for-nazis-idUSKBN30U0GX
3,Capsule with NASA's first asteroid sample heads for Utah touchdown | Reuters,"September 24, 2023",3:20 PM UTC,"Sept 24 (Reuters) - A NASA capsule carrying the largest soil sample ever collected from an asteroid is due to return to Earth on Sunday, expected to streak through the atmosphere and parachute into the Utah desert to deliver its celestial specimen to scientists.The robotic spacecraft OSIRIS-REx is scheduled to release the gumdrop-shaped capsule, transporting about a cup of gravelly asteroid material, at 6:42 a.m. EDT (1042 GMT) for a final descent to Earth, climaxing a seven-year voyage.Plans call for the capsule to touch down a little more than four hours later within a 250-square-mile (650-sq-km) landing zone west of Salt Lake City on the U.S. military's vast Utah Test and Training Range.Success of the mission, a joint effort between NASA and the University of Arizona, would mark the third asteroid sample, and by far the biggest, ever returned to Earth for analysis, following two similar missions by Japan's space agency ending in 2010 and 2020.OSIRIS-REx collected its specimen from Bennu, a small, carbon-rich asteroid discovered in 1999 and classified as a ""near-Earth object"" because it passes relatively close to our planet every six years, though the odds of an impact are considered remote.Apparently made up of a loose collection of rocks, like a rubble pile, Bennu measures just 500 meters (1,600 ft) across, making it slightly wider than the Empire State Building is tall but tiny compared with the Chicxulub asteroid that struck Earth some 66 million years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs.Like other asteroids, Bennu is a relic of the early solar system. Because its present-day chemistry and mineralogy are virtually unchanged since forming some 4.5 billion years ago, it holds valuable clues to the origins and development of rocky planets such as Earth.It may even contain organic molecules similar to those necessary for the emergence of microbes.Samples returned three years ago by the Japanese mission Hayabusa2 from Ryugu, another near-Earth asteroid, were found to contain two organic compounds, buttressing the hypothesis that celestial objects such as comets, asteroids and meteorites that bombarded early Earth seeded the young planet with the primordial ingredients for life.OSIRIS-REx launched in September 2016 and reached Bennu in 2018, then spent nearly two years orbiting the asteroid before venturing close enough to snatch a sample of the loose surface material with its robot arm on Oct. 20, 2020.The spacecraft departed Bennu in May 2021 for a 1.2-billion-mile (1.9-billion-km) cruise back to Earth, including two orbits around the sun. If mission control commands the release of the sample-return capsule as planned, it will be jettisoned within 67,000 miles of Earth for the final leg of its return flight.Hitting the upper atmosphere at 35 times the speed of sound, the capsule is expected to glow red hot as it plunges earthward and temperatures inside the vessel peak at 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,800°C).Parachutes are designed to deploy near the very end of the descent, slowing the capsule to about 11 mph before it falls gently onto the desert floor of northwestern Utah.The Bennu sample is estimated at 250 grams (8.8 ounces), far surpassing the 5 grams of material carried back from Ryugu in 2020 or the tiny specimen delivered from asteroid Itokawa in 2010.Scientists hope the integrity of the capsule and inner cannister bearing the asteroid material will be maintained through re-entry and landing, keeping the sample pristine and free of any terrestrial contamination.On arrival, the sample will be flown by helicopter to a ""clean room"" at the Utah test range for initial examination, then transported to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, to be parceled into smaller specimens promised to some 200 scientists in 60 laboratories around the world.The main portion of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, meanwhile, is expected to sail on to explore yet another near-Earth asteroid, named Apophis.",https://www.reuters.com/article/space-exploration-asteroid/nasa-asteroid-sample-parachutes-safely-onto-utah-desert-idUSKBN30U01Y
4,Asia Olympic body backs North Korea flag at Hangzhou despite WADA ban | Reuters,"September 24, 2023",4:22 PM UTC,"HANGZHOU, China, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) said it was happy for the North Korea flag to keep flying at the Hangzhou Asian Games despite it being banned over the country's non-compliance with global anti-doping rules.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned the flag at all major sporting events, outside the Olympic and Paralympic Games, in 2021 after deeming that North Korea had failed to implement an effective testing programme.But North Korean athletes marched proudly behind the flag at Saturday's opening ceremony in Hangzhou and it has been displayed at competitions and in the athletes' village.Acting OCA President Randhir Singh said Asian Games organisers and North Korea were in discussions with WADA but that the flag was still flying.""North Korea also has written to WADA as well, explaining their position,"" he told reporters on Sunday.""We are explaining it from our side as well. At present the North Korea flag is flying and we will look into it and see what the future says.""Let me tell you, our intention is that everyone should participate and everyone should have the opportunity to participate.""And if there are certain issues that happen through this pandemic and that period, so we should consider that, take it into account.""WADA said North Korea was still non-compliant with its anti-doping code and the OCA had failed to enforce its sanction.""As such after the opening ceremony, WADA wrote to the OCA to remind them of their obligations and to inform them that a compliance procedure would be opened against them as appropriate,"" the anti-doping body said in a statement.The Hangzhou Asian Games is the first international multi-sport event North Korea is attending since the 2018 edition in Jakarta.North Korea was suspended from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) until the end of 2022, missing last year's Beijing Winter Games, after failing to send a team to the Summer Olympics in Tokyo.The Asian Games was originally due to host up to 500 athletes from Russia and Belarus, despite widespread competition bans for the countries' athletes following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"".However, the IOC confirmed in the lead-up to Hangzhou that they would not participate due to ""logistical"" issues.Singh said the athletes would have ""otherwise been most welcome"" and left the door open for them to participate at future Asian competitions.",https://www.reuters.com/article/games-asia-northkorea/games-asia-olympic-body-backs-north-korea-flag-at-hangzhou-despite-wada-ban-idUSKBN30U04F
5,"Taiwan expects to deploy two new submarines by 2027, security adviser says | Reuters","September 25, 2023",12:03 AM UTC,"TAIPEI, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Taiwan hopes to deploy at least two new, domestically developed submarines by 2027, and possibly equip later models with missiles, to strengthen deterrence against the Chinese navy and protect key supply lines, the head of the program said.Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has made the indigenous sub program a key part of an ambitious project to modernise its armed forces as Beijing stages almost daily military exercises to assert its sovereignty.President Tsai Ing-wen, who initiated the program when she took office in 2016, is expected to launch the first of eight new submarines on Thursday under a plan that has drawn on expertise and technology from several countries - a breakthrough for diplomatically isolated Taiwan.Admiral Huang Shu-kuang, Tsai's security adviser, who is leading the program, said a fleet of 10 submarines - which includes two Dutch-made submarines commissioned in the 1980s - will make it harder for the Chinese navy to project power into the Pacific.""If we can build up this combat capacity, I don't think we will lose a war,"" Huang this month told an internal briefing on the project, which was attended by Reuters.Huang said the first submarine, with a price tag of T$49.36 billion ($1.54 billion), will use a combat system by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and carry U.S.-made MK-48 heavyweight torpedoes. It will enter sea trials next month before delivery to the navy by the end of 2024.For subsequent models, Taiwan will leave space for submarine-launched anti-ship missiles, but adding those weapons depends on production availability in a U.S., where capacity was already tight, Huang said, without naming the companies that might be involved.He called the submarines a ""strategic deterrent"" to Chinese warships crossing the Miyako Strait near southwestern Japan or the Bashi Channel that separates Taiwan from the Philippines.Huang said Taiwan's diesel-electric submarines can keep China at bay within the first island chain, referring to the area that runs from Japan through Taiwan, the Philippines and on to Borneo, enclosing China's coastal seas.""This was also the strategic concept of the U.S. military - to contain them within the first island chain and deny their access,"" Huang said. ""If Taiwan is taken, Japan will definitely not be safe, South Korea will definitely not be safe.""China's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment.The Chinese navy, including its Shandong aircraft carrier, has become increasingly active in recent months off Taiwan's eastern coastline, prompting worries that China could launch an attack from that direction. Eastern Taiwan is where planners have long envisioned the island's military regrouping and preserving its forces during a conflict.Huang said the submarines can help maintain the island's ""lifeline"" to the Pacific by keeping ports along Taiwan's eastern coast open for supplies in a conflict.""The submarines will keep their ships away from our eastern shores,"" he said.Chieh Chung, a military researcher at Taiwan's National Policy Foundation think tank, said the fleet would have trouble with that task, because China could position warships in the Pacific before launching an attack.But he added that the submarines could occupy strategic ambush points in the region and ""greatly harm (China's) combat ability"" by targeting high-value ships such as carrier groups or landing fleets.Taiwan has quietly sourced technology, components and talent from at least seven nations to help it build submarines, a Reuters investigation has found.Getting foreign assistance was particularly challenging for Taiwan, which doesn't have official ties with most countries.Huang declined to say which countries had approved export permits, but said he had reached out to generals from countries that included the United States, Japan, South Korea and India.""For those foreign generals who agreed with my ideas, they helped convey the message to their governments or arrange meetings,"" he said. ""I told them our needs and that's how we achieved our purpose of securing export permits.""Huang also expressed thanks for the ""great help"" from a team led by an unnamed retired rear admiral of Britain's Royal Navy, who secured export permits from Britain through a Gibraltar-based company.Britain sharply increased the amount of submarine parts and technology exports approved last year for Taiwan, a Reuters analysis of the data showed.Huang described the program as ""even harder than reaching the sky,"" pointing to challenges such as a global chip shortage that hit many manufacturers around the world. He said his team scrambled to source chips from Taiwan to avoid delays by foreign vendors.A foreign supplier had also pull out at the last minute after the work with Taiwan was leaked to a Chinese embassy, he said, without elaborating.He said China's frequent military harassment, including close approaches to Taiwan's territorial waters and airspace, has prompted Taiwan and the United States to rethink the island's ""asymmetrical"" strategy of making its forces more mobile and harder to attack, with a focus on smaller weapons systems.""The American thinking is changing gradually. They realised that you can't withstand (the harassment) without bigger boats,"" Huang said, pointing to the navy's plan to build a new generation of bigger frigates.""They are getting closer and closer,"" he added, referring to China. ""Taiwan can't drive them out with small boats. We must use bigger boats.""($1 = 31.9840 Taiwan dollars)",https://www.reuters.com/article/taiwan-defence-submarine/taiwan-expects-to-deploy-two-new-submarines-by-2027-security-adviser-idUSKBN30V005
6,Turkey's Erdogan to meet Azeri's Aliyev as thousands flee Karabakh | Reuters,"September 25, 2023",3:04 AM UTC,"Sept 25 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is to meet his ally Azeri President Ilham Aliyev on Monday, as thousands of ethnic Armenians began an exodus from Nagorno-Karabakh after Azerbaijan defeated the breakaway region's fighters last week.Erdogan will pay a one-day visit to Azerbaijan's autonomous Nakhchivan exclave - a strip of Azeri territory nestled between Armenia, Iran and Turkey - to discuss with Aliyev the situation in the Karabakh region, the Turkish president's office said.The Armenians of Karabakh, a territory internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but previously beyond its control, were forced into a ceasefire last week after a 24-hour military operation by the much-larger Azerbaijani military.On Sunday, the Nagorno-Karabakh leadership told Reuters the region's 120,000 Armenians did not want to live as part of Azerbaijan for fear of persecution and ethnic cleansing and started fleeing the area.Russia's RIA news agency cited early on Monday an Armenian government statement saying that more than 1,500 people had crossed into Armenia from Nagorno-Karabkah as of midnight (2000 GMT).Those with fuel had started to drive down the Lachin corridor toward the border with Armenia, according to a Reuters reporter in the Karabakh capital known as Stepanakert by Armenia and Khankendi by Azerbaijan.Reuters pictures showed dozens of cars driving out of the capital toward the corridor's mountainous curves.Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought two wars over the enclave in 30 years -- with Azerbaijan gaining back swathes of territory in and around Nagorno-Karabakh in a six-week conflict in 2020.Erdogan, who backed the Azeris with weaponry in the 2020 conflict, said last week he supported the aims of the Azerbaijan's latest military operation but played no part in it.Armenia says more than 200 people were killed and 400 wounded in last week's Azeri operation, a hostility condemned by the United States and other Western allies of Armenia.On Sunday, Azerbaijan's defence ministry said it had confiscated more military equipment from Armenian separatists, including rockets, artillery shells, mines and ammunition.The Karabakh Armenians are not accepting Azerbaijan's promise to guarantee their rights as the region is integrated. Armenia called for an immediate deployment of a U.N. mission to monitor human rights and security in the region.""Ninety-nine point nine percent prefer to leave our historic lands,"" David Babayan, an adviser to Samvel Shahramanyan, president of the self-styled Republic of Artsakh, told Reuters.",https://www.reuters.com/article/armenia-zerbaijan/turkeys-erdogan-to-meet-azeris-aliyev-as-thousands-flee-karabakh-idUSKBN30V037
7,Republicans appeal to far right to avert US government shutdown | Reuters,"September 24, 2023",10:08 PM UTC,"WASHINGTON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - With just a week before Washington runs out of money to keep the federal government fully operating, warring factions within the Republican Party in the U.S. Congress on Sunday showed no signs of coming together to pass a stopgap funding bill.Congress so far has failed to finish any of the 12 regular spending bills to fund federal agency programs in the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1.House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy will push an ambitious plan this week to win approval of four large bills, including military and homeland security funding, that he hopes would demonstrate enough progress to far-right Republicans to win their support for a stop-gap spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, or CR, as well.Republican Representative Michael McCaul, a 19-year veteran of Congress who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, urged the group of party ""holdouts"" to stop blocking Republican-backed spending bills while at the same time ""saying don't bring bipartisan bills to the floor.""""Republicans need to vote for Republican bills"" to avert a shutdown, McCaul said on ABC's ""This Week"" broadcast.But some of those ""holdouts,"" who want deep spending cuts that go beyond a deal passed earlier this year, showed no sign of relenting.""Continuing resolutions don't solve the problem. They just kick the can down the road,"" Republican Representative Tony Gonzalez told CBS News' ""Face the Nation.""In June, President Joe Biden signed into law an increase in U.S. borrowing authority that he brokered with McCarthy, which also came with around $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years.Ultra-right House Republicans want to go further with around $120 billion in additional cuts just for the new fiscal year, which could hit programs ranging from education and environmental protection to Internal Revenue Service enforcement and medical research.Similarly, Republican Representative Tim Burchett told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he has never voted for a temporary funding bill and won't this time around.He warned that if McCarthy allows legislation to pass the House with Democratic support, ""I would look strongly at"" a move to strip McCarthy of his speakership.""This dysfunctional Washington cannot continue,"" Burchett said, referring to the way Congress handles the federal budget, which is on a path to a $1.5 trillion deficit for the fiscal year that ends on Saturday.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg warned in an ABC interview that a government shutdown will require his agency to immediately suspend air traffic controller training courses at a time when air travel is ""getting back to normal"" following a high volume of flight delays and disruptions last year.Aides to McCarthy were not immediately available for comment on whether negotiations over a CR were continuing on Sunday.But he has been pushing for a 30-day bill to keep federal offices open, coupled with a strict border security plan that would basically suspend most immigration into the United States at a time of record numbers of people seeking asylum on the border with Mexico.Even some of the Senate's most conservative Republicans on Sunday appealed to House counterparts to stop blocking a stop-gap bill.""We would like for the House to begin that process of sending us a CR to keep the government open and functioning,"" Senator Marsha Blackburn told Fox Business News.Appealing to those conservatives' eagerness for conducting investigations into Biden and some other top administration officials, Blackburn added: ""If you shut down the government you can't continue that.""",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-shutdown/republicans-appeal-to-far-right-conservatives-to-avert-us-government-shutdown-idUSKBN30U0AV
8,Striking Hollywood writers reach tentative deal with studios | Reuters,"September 25, 2023",3:31 AM UTC,"LOS ANGELES, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Hollywood's writers union reached a preliminary labor agreement with major studios on Sunday, a deal expected to end one of two strikes that have halted most film and television production and cost the California economy billions.The three-year contract still must be approved by leadership of the Writers Guild of America (WGA,) as well as union members, before it can take effect.The WGA, which represents 11,500 film and television writers, described the deal as ""exceptional"" with ""meaningful gains and protections for writers.""""This was made possible by the enduring solidarity of WGA members and extraordinary support of our union siblings who joined us on the picket lines for over 146 days,"" the negotiating committee said in a statement Sunday.The WGA settlement, while a milestone, will not return Hollywood to business as usual even if it is ratified. While writing may resume, the SAG-AFTRA actors' union remains on strike.Writers walked off the job on May 2 after negotiations reached an impasse over compensation, minimum staffing of writers' rooms, the use of artificial intelligence and residuals that reward writers for popular streaming shows, among other issues.""We stuck it out,"" WGA liaison Caroline Renard said Sunday. ""This is a union industry, and it's about the people that make the actual product that makes these company billions of dollars.""One writer posted an image on social media of a picket sign that read simply: ""The End.""The only comment from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the trade group representing Walt Disney (DIS.N), Netflix (NFLX.O), Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O) and other major studios, came in a brief statement with the union.""The WGA and AMPTP have reached a tentative agreement,"" the statement said.The proposed contract is still preliminary. The WGA's negotiating committee said it would share details only after it receives final contract language. After that, the negotiators will vote on whether to recommend the deal to leadership, which must then decide if they will present it to members for a vote.Hollywood's dual strikes had shut down production of movies and TV series and sent late-night talk shows into re-runs. Efforts to restart daytime talk shows without writers, such as ""The Drew Barrymore Show,"" collapsed this month, in the face of criticism from striking writers and actors.At picket lines, protests took on the rhetoric of class warfare. Writers assailed media executives' compensation and said working conditions had made it hard for them to earn a middle-class living.Executives at times fanned tensions. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger, fresh off a contract extension that offered an annual bonus of five times his base salary, criticized striking writers and actors as ""just not realistic"" in their demands.Iger subsequently struck a conciliatory note, citing his ""deep respect"" for creative professionals.""It's been a long road, and I'm ready to take the next step forward, which is just like healing for our guild and getting back to work on ourselves,"" ""Harlem"" writer Brandon K. Hines said on Sunday.The work stoppages took a toll on camera operators, carpenters, production assistants and other crew members, as well as the caterers, florists, costume suppliers and other small businesses that support film and television production.The economic cost is expected to total at least $5 billion in California and the other U.S. production hubs of New Mexico, Georgia and New York, according to an estimate from Milken Institute economist Kevin Klowden.Four top industry executives - Iger, Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos and NBCUniversal (CMCSA.O) Studio Group Chair Donna Langley - joined negotiations this week, helping to break the months-long impasse.As with past writers' strikes, this job action responds to Hollywood capitalizing on a new form of distribution - and writers seek to participate in the newfound revenue. The 100-day strike in 2007-08 focused, in part, on extending guild protections to ""new media,"" including movies and TV downloads as well as content delivered via ad-supported internet services.This time around, a central issue is residual payments for streaming services, which writers said represented a fraction of the compensation they would receive for a broadcast television show. Writers also sought limits on AI's role in the creative process. Some feared that studio executives would hand a writer an AI-generated script to revise, and pay the writer at a lower rate to rewrite or polish it. Others expressed concerns about intellectual property theft if existing scripts are used to train artificial intelligence.Reuters reported that Disney has created a task force to study artificial intelligence and how it can be applied across the entertainment conglomerate, signaling its importance.Even as studio executives celebrated the end of the longest-running writers' strike since 1988, it is only half the labor battle. The studios must still find a way to get actors back to work.SAG-AFTRA, representing 160,000 film and television actors, stunt performers, voiceover artists and other media professionals, walked off the job in July, the first time in 63 years that Hollywood faced a strike by two unions at the same time.In a statement late Sunday, SAG-AFTRA urged studio CEOs and their negotiators ""to return to the table and make the fair deal that our members deserve and demand.""At issue are questions of minimum wages for performers, protections against the use of artificial intelligence replacing human performances and compensation that reflects the value actors bring to the streaming services.",https://www.reuters.com/article/television-writers-agreement/striking-hollywood-writers-reach-tentative-deal-with-studios-idUSKBN30V035

Hits were identified,"" the military said in a statement, adding that an Israeli soldier was moderately wounded.Hamas, which has been extending its reach away from its base in Gaza and into the West Bank, said one of the men who were killed, 21-year-old Osaid Abu Ali, was a member of its armed wing.The family of the other man, 32-year-old Abdel-Rahman Abu Daghash, said he had stepped on to the roof of his house to observe what was going on when he was killed by a sniper.""He went up to the rooftop to film the ambulances. He barely had the chance to look and the sniper targeted him,"" said his brother Mo'men Abu Daghash.

There was no word on any casualties.In a separate incident, the Israeli military said it had detained eight students from Bir Zeit University in the West bank whom it described as wanted suspects linked to Hamas, and whom it said planned to carry out an attack in the immediate future.",https://www.reuters.com/article/israel-palestinians/israeli-forces-kill-two-palestinians-in-west-bank-raid-hamas-emergency-workers-idUSKBN30U02D

11,Serb gunmen battle police in Kosovo monastery siege; four dead | Reuters,"September 24, 2023",8:38 PM UTC,"NORTH MITROVICA, Kosovo, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Ethnic Serb gunmen in armoured vehicles stormed a village in north Kosovo on Sunday, battling police and barricading themselves in a monastery in a resurgence of violence in the restive north that killed four people.The siege centred on a Serbian Orthodox monastery near the village of Banjska in the Serb-majority region where monks and pilgrims hid inside a temple as a shootout raged.One police officer and three of the attackers died, according to authorities in Kosovo and Serbia.Ethnic Albanians form the vast majority of the 1.8 million population of Kosovo, a former province of Serbia.But some 50,000 Serbs in the north have never accepted Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence and still see Belgrade as their capital, more than two decades after a Kosovo Albanian guerrilla uprising against repressive Serbian rule.A group of Kosovo Serbs positioned trucks on a bridge into the village, shooting at police who approached them, before the battle moved to the nearby monastery, according to accounts by both Kosovo police and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.The gunmen had left the monastery by night, the Serbian Orthodox Church said, though it was unclear where they went.Vucic said the action was a rebellion against Kurti, who has refused to form an association of Serb municipalities in north Kosovo. ""Serbia will never recognise independent Kosovo, you can kill us all,"" he said.Two Serbs were seriously injured and a fourth among them may have died, Vucic said. He condemned the killing of the police officer and urged restraint from Kosovo Serbs.The Serbian Orthodox Church's diocese of Raska-Prizren, which includes Banjska, said men in an armoured vehicle entered the monastery compound, forcing monks and visiting faithful to lock themselves inside the temple.The Kosovo police later said they had entered the monastery and were checking for possible infiltrators among worshippers. Three of their personnel were also injured, as well as the fatality in their ranks, police said.Kosovo's Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla said police found a large number of heavy weapons, explosives and uniforms ""that were enough for hundreds of other attackers"", indicating preparations for a massive assault.The head of the U.N. mission in Kosovo, Caroline Ziadeh, and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell condemned the violence.Borrell talked with both Kurti and Vucic, according to his office.NATO troops, along with members of the EU police force EULEX and Kosovo police, could be seen patrolling the road leading to Banjska, according to a Reuters reporter nearby.Kosovo border police closed two crossings with Serbia.Serbs in north Kosovo have long demanded the implementation of a EU-brokered 2013 deal for the creation of an association of autonomous municipalities in their area.EU-sponsored talks on normalising relations between Serbia and Kosovo stalled last week, with the bloc blaming Kurti for failing to set up the association.Pristina sees the plan as a recipe for a mini-state within Kosovo, effectively partitioning the country along ethnic lines.Serbia still formally deems Kosovo to be part of its territory, but denies suggestions of whipping up strife within its neighbour's borders.

12,Explainer: Why Kosovo's stand-off with Serbs goes on 15 years after statehood | Reuters,"September 24, 2023",5:57 PM UTC,"Sept 24 (Reuters) - The storming of a north Kosovo monastery has thrown attention on persistent trouble in the ethnic Serbian-majority region 15 years after Pristina declared independence.Here are facts about the unrest.Independence for ethnic Albanian-majority Kosovo came on Feb. 17, 2008, almost a decade after a guerrilla uprising against repressive Serbian rule.It is recognised by more than 100 countries.Serbia, however, still formally deems Kosovo to be part of its territory. It accuses Kosovo's central government of trampling on the rights of ethnic Serbs but denies accusations of whipping up strife within its neighbour's borders.Serbs account for 5% of Kosovo's 1.8 million people, and ethnic Albanians about 90%. Some 50,000 Serbs in north Kosovo, on the border with Serbia, vent their rejectionism by refusing to pay the state utility for energy they use and often attacking police who try to make arrests.All of them receive benefits from Serbia's budget and pay no taxes either to Pristina or Belgrade.Unrest in the region intensified when ethnic Albanian mayors took office in northern Kosovo's Serb-majority area after April elections the Serbs boycotted, a move that led the U.S. and its allies to rebuke Pristina.Last December, North Kosovo Serbs erected multiple roadblocks and exchanged fire with police after a former Serb policeman was arrested for allegedly assaulting serving police officers during a previous protest.But tensions had been ticking upward for months in a dispute over car license plates. Kosovo has for years wanted Serbs in the north to switch their Serbian license plates, dating to the pre-independence era, to ones issued by Pristina, as part of its policy to assert authority over all of Kosovo territory.Last July, Pristina announced a two-month window for the plates to be switched over, triggering unrest, but later agreed to push the implementation date back to the end of 2023.Ethnic Serb mayors in northern municipalities, along with local judges and 600 police officers, resigned in November last year in protest at the looming switch, deepening dysfunction and lawlessness in the region.Serbs in Kosovo seek to create an association of majority-Serb municipalities operating with considerable autonomy.Pristina rejects this as a recipe for a mini-state within Kosovo, effectively partitioning the country along ethnic lines.Serbia and Kosovo have made little progress on this and other issues since committing in 2013 to a European Union-sponsored dialogue aimed at normalising ties - for both a requirement for EU membership.The transatlantic NATO military alliance retains 3,700 peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, the remainder of an original 50,000-strong force deployed in 1999.The alliance says it would intervene in line with its mandate if Kosovo were at risk of renewed conflict. The EU's EULEX mission, begun in 2008 to train domestic police and crack down on graft and gangsterism, retains 200 special police officers in Kosovo.U.S. and EU envoys are pressing Serbia and Kosovo to approve a plan presented in mid-2022 under which Belgrade would stop lobbying against a Kosovo seat in international organisations including the United Nations.Kosovo would commit to form an association of Serb-majority municipalities. And both sides would open representative offices in each other's capital to help resolve outstanding disputes.But talks on normalising relations between the two former wartime foes stalled last week, with the EU blaming Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti for failing to set up the association of municipalities.Kurti, who had agreed such an association should have only limited powers whose decisions could be overruled by central government, accused the EU mediator of siding with Serbia to pressure him to implement only one part of the deal.Serbia's president appears ready to approve the plan, warning recalcitrant nationalists in parliament that Belgrade will otherwise face damaging isolation in Europe.But with nationalist hardliners powerful on both sides, not least among north Kosovo Serbs, no breakthrough is on the horizon.The area of north Kosovo where Serbs form a majority is in important ways a virtual extension of Serbia. Local administration and public servants, teachers, doctors and big infrastructure projects are paid for by Belgrade.Local Serbs fear that once fully integrated within Kosovo they could lose benefits such as Serbia's free public healthcare and be forced onto Kosovo's private healthcare system.They also fear pensions would be smaller, given that the average monthly pension in Kosovo is worth 100 euros ($107)compared with 270 euros in Serbia.($1 = 0.9388 euros)",https://www.reuters.com/article/kosovo-serbs/explainer-why-kosovos-stand-off-with-serbs-goes-on-15-years-after-statehood-idUSKBN30U0A8
13,Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenians start to leave en masse for Armenia | Reuters,"September 24, 2023",10:39 PM UTC,"STEPANAKERT, Azerbaijan, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh began a mass exodus by car on Sunday toward Armenia after Azerbaijan defeated the breakaway region's fighters in a conflict dating from the Soviet era.The Nagorno-Karabakh leadership told Reuters the region's 120,000 Armenians did not want to live as part of Azerbaijan for fear of persecution and ethnic cleansing.Those with fuel had started to drive down the Lachin corridor toward the border with Armenia, according to a Reuters reporter in the Karabakh capital known as Stepanakert by Armenia and Khankendi by Azerbaijan.An Armenian government statement said 1,050 people had crossed into Armenia from Nagorno-Karabkah as of 10 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Sunday.Reuters pictures showed dozens of cars driving out of the capital toward the corridor's mountainous curves.The Armenians of Karabakh, a territory internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but previously beyond its control, were forced into a ceasefire last week after a 24-hour military operation by the much-larger Azerbaijani military.Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought two wars over the enclave in 30 years -- with Azerbaijan gaining back swathes of territory in and around Nagorno-Karabakh in a six-week conflict in 2020.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who backed the Azeris with weaponry in the 2020 conflict, was due on Monday to meet Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev in Nakhchivan -- a strip of Azeri territory nestled between Armenia, Iran and Turkey.Erdogan last week said he supported the aims of Azerbaijan's latest military operation but played no part in it.The Armenians are not accepting Azerbaijan's promise to guarantee their rights as the region is integrated.""Ninety-nine point nine percent prefer to leave our historic lands,"" David Babayan, an adviser to Samvel Shahramanyan, president of the self-styled Republic of Artsakh, told Reuters.""The fate of our poor people will go down in history as a disgrace and a shame for the Armenian people and for the whole civilised world,"" Babayan said. ""Those responsible for our fate will one day have to answer before God for their sins.""The Armenian leaders of Karabakh said that all those made homeless by the Azerbaijani military operation and wanting to leave would be escorted to Armenia by Russian peacekeepers.Reuters reporters near the village of Kornidzor on the Armenian border saw some heavily laden cars pass into Armenia. Armenia said 377 refugees had arrived by Sunday evening.Armenia Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has faced calls to resign for failing to save Karabakh. In an address to the nation, he said some aid had arrived but a mass exodus looked inevitable.""If proper conditions are not created for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their homes and there are no effective protection mechanisms against ethnic cleansing, the likelihood is rising that the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh will see exile from their homeland as the only way to save their lives and identity,"" he said, according to an official transcript.The situation could change the delicate balance of power in the South Caucasus region, a patchwork of ethnicities crisscrossed with oil and gas pipelines where Russia, the United States, Turkey and Iran vie for influence.Last week's Azerbaijani victory appears to end one of the decades-old ""frozen conflicts"" of the Soviet Union's dissolution. Aliyev said his ""iron fist"" had consigned the idea of an independent ethnic Armenian Karabakh to history and that the region would be turned into a ""paradise.""Armenia says more than 200 people were killed and 400 wounded in the Azerbaijani military operation.Nagorno-Karabakh lies in an area that over centuries has come under the sway of Persians, Turks, Russians, Ottomans and Soviets. It was claimed by both Azerbaijan and Armenia after the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917. In Soviet times it was designated an autonomous region within Azerbaijan.As the Soviet Union crumbled, the Armenians there threw off nominal Azeri control and captured neighbouring territory in what is now known as the First Karabakh War. From 1988 to 1994 about 30,000 people were killed and more than 1 million -- mostly Azeris -- displaced.In 2020, after decades of skirmishes, Azerbaijan won a decisive 44-day Second Karabakh War. That war ended with a Russian-brokered peace deal Armenians accuse Moscow of failing to guarantee.The Armenian authorities in the region on Saturday said about 150 tonnes of humanitarian cargo from Russia and another 65 tonnes of flour shipped by the International Committee of the Red Cross had arrived in the region.With 2,000 peacekeepers present, Russia said that under the terms of the ceasefire, six armoured vehicles, more than 800 small arms, anti-tank weapons and portable air defence systems, plus 22,000 ammunition rounds had been handed in by Saturday.Space for 40,000 people from Karabakh had been prepared in Armenia. Azerbaijan, which is mainly Muslim, has said that the Armenians, who are Christian, can leave if they want.Pashinyan on Sunday blamed Russia for failing to do enough for Armenia, which he said would review its alliance with Moscow.""Some of our partners are increasingly making efforts to expose our security vulnerabilities, putting at risk not only our external, but also internal, security and stability while violating all norms of etiquette and correctness in diplomatic and interstate relations, including obligations assumed under treaties,"" Pashinyan said in his Sunday address.Russian officials say Pashinyan is to blame for his own mishandling of the crisis.",https://www.reuters.com/article/armenia-azerbaijan/karabakhs-armenians-start-to-leave-en-masse-for-armenia-idUSKBN30U020
14,France to pull troops out of Niger following coup | Reuters,,,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will pull its soldiers out of Niger following a July coup in the West African country, President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday, dealing a huge blow to French influence and counter-insurgency operations in the Sahel region.Macron said 1,500 troops would withdraw by the end of the year and that France, the former colonial power in Niger, refused to “be held hostage by the putchists”.France’s exit, which comes after weeks of pressure from the junta and popular demonstrations, is likely to exacerbate Western concerns over Russia’s expanding influence in Africa. The Russian mercenary force Wagner already present in Niger’s neighbour Mali.The French president has refused to recognise the junta as Niger’s legitimate authority but said Paris would coordinate troop withdraw with the coup leaders.“We will consult with the putschists because we want things to be orderly,” Macron said in an interview with France’s TF1 and France 2 television stations.France’s ambassador was also being pulled out and would return to the country in the next few hours, Macron added.French influence over its former colonies has waned in West Africa in recent years, just as popular vitriol has grown. Its forces have been kicked out of neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso since coups in those countries, reducing its role in a region-wide fight against deadly Islamist insurgencies.Until the coup, Niger had remained a key security partner of France and the United States, which have used it as a base to fight an Islamist insurgency in West and Central Africa’s wider Sahel region.France’s military base in Niger’s capital, Niamey, had become the epicentre of anti-French protests since the July 26 coup.Groups have regularly gathered on the street outside to call for the exit of troops stationed in the capital. On one Saturday this month, tens of thousands rallied against France, slitting the throat of a goat dressed in French colours and carrying coffins draped in French flags.Pro-coup demonstrators in Niamey have waved Russian flags, adding to Western countries’ fears that Niger could follow Mali’s lead and replace their troops with Wagner fighters.Before his death in a plane crash last month, Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin spoke in a social media clip of making Russia greater on all continents and Africa more free. Wagner’s future has been unclear since his demise.Wagner is also active in Central African Republic and Libya. Western nations say it is also present in Sudan, though it denies this. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for a return to constitutional order in Niger.French nuclear power plants source a small amount - less than 10% - of their uranium from Niger, with France’s state-owned Orano operating a mine in Niger’s north.Macron said he still regarded democratically elected President Mohammed Bazoum, currently held prisoner by the coup leaders, as Niger’s legitimate leader and had informed him of his decision.",https://www.reuters.com/article/nigeria-security-france/france-to-pull-troops-out-of-niger-following-coup-idUSKBN30U0CO

There were two KAMAZ-truckloads full of civilian dead in the village, he said.""There was nowhere to bury them,"" Grigoryan told Reuters after making his way down the Lachin corridor and across the border into Armenia, where Reuters interviewed him and other refugees in the border town of Goris.""We took what we could and left.

But Leeser, a Democrat, said all of the migrants on the El Paso buses were going voluntarily to the cities of their choice.Leeser said the Biden had been a good partner. But he said the overall U.S. immigration system was broken.Many migrants from Venezuela, he said, lacked transportation to their desired destinations, while El Paso's current shelter houses only 400 people, and must also be available to help the homeless.As recently as six weeks ago, about 350 to 400 people were crossing into El Paso per day, but the past few days have brought 2,000 or more.Over the past 10 days, the city has worked with the U.S. Border Patrol to provide shelter for 6,500 people, Leeser said.About two-thirds of those crossing into El Paso currently are single men, he said. About 32% are families and just 2% are unaccompanied children.""I think it's really important to note that we have a broken immigration system,"" he said.

The 'No' vote had reached 50%.Despite the Anthony Albanese-led Labor government's campaign drive to win undecided voters, opposition to the referendum rose three points to 56%, a Newspoll conducted for The Australian newspaper showed. Support dipped to 36% from 38% in the previous poll on Sept. 3.Altering the constitution requires a national referendum in Australia and only eight have passed since 1901 when the country was formed. The proposal must get a majority of votes nationwide and at least four of the six states must back the change.Australia, which will hold the referendum vote on Oct. 14, has no treaty with its Indigenous people, who make up about 3.2% of its 26 million population. They were marginalised by British colonial rulers and are not mentioned in the 122-year-old constitution.The referendum debate has divided opinions with supporters arguing the Voice will bring progress for the Aboriginal community, while opponents say it would be divisive. Others have described it as tokenism and toothless.Voters who had switched their stance to reject the proposal in the past five months said the Voice was creating distraction from their top two issues - the cost of living and the cost of housing, the AFR survey said.It also showed the approval ratings for Albanese, who has staked significant political capital on the referendum, fell 5 points to 46%.In the Newspoll survey, Albanese's ratings improved slightly to 47% though that remained at historically low levels, while on a two-party preferred basis, Labor enjoyed a 54-46% lead against the conservative opposition coalition.",https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-indigenous/polls-show-australia-indigenous-referendum-support-slipping-likely-to-fail-idUSKBN30U0GZ
