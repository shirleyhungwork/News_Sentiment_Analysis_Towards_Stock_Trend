0,Taiwan expects to deploy two new submarines by 2027 -security adviser By Reuters,"Published Sep 24, 2023 08:03PM ET","Position added successfully to: 
By Yimou LeeTAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan hopes to deploy at least two new, domestically developed submarines by 2027, and possibly equip later models with missiles, to strengthen deterrence against the Chinese navy and protect key supply lines, the head of the program said.Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has made the indigenous sub program a key part of an ambitious project to modernise its armed forces as Beijing stages almost daily military exercises to assert its sovereignty.President Tsai Ing-wen, who initiated the program when she took office in 2016, is expected to launch the first of eight new submarines on Thursday under a plan that has drawn on expertise and technology from several countries - a breakthrough for diplomatically isolated Taiwan.Admiral Huang Shu-kuang, Tsai's security adviser, who is leading the program, said a fleet of 10 submarines - which includes two Dutch-made submarines commissioned in the 1980s - will make it harder for the Chinese navy to project power into the Pacific.""If we can build up this combat capacity, I don't think we will lose a war,"" Huang this month told an internal briefing on the project, which was attended by Reuters.Huang said the first submarine, with a price tag of T$49.36 billion ($1.54 billion), will use a combat system by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and carry U.S.-made MK-48 heavyweight torpedoes. It will enter sea trials next month before delivery to the navy by the end of 2024.For subsequent models, Taiwan will leave space for submarine-launched anti-ship missiles, but adding those weapons depends on production availability in a U.S., where capacity was already tight, Huang said, without naming the companies that might be involved.He called the submarines a ""strategic deterrent"" to Chinese warships crossing the Miyako Strait near southwestern Japan or the Bashi Channel that separates Taiwan from the Philippines.Huang said Taiwan's diesel-electric submarines can keep China at bay within the first island chain, referring to the area that runs from Japan through Taiwan, the Philippines and on to Borneo, enclosing China's coastal seas.""This was also the strategic concept of the U.S. military - to contain them within the first island chain and deny their access,"" Huang said. ""If Taiwan is taken, Japan will definitely not be safe, South Korea will definitely not be safe.""China's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment.The Chinese navy, including its Shandong aircraft carrier, has become increasingly active in recent months off Taiwan's eastern coastline, prompting worries that China could launch an attack from that direction. Eastern Taiwan is where planners have long envisioned the island's military regrouping and preserving its forces during a conflict.Huang said the submarines can help maintain the island's ""lifeline"" to the Pacific by keeping ports along Taiwan's eastern coast open for supplies in a conflict.""The submarines will keep their ships away from our eastern shores,"" he said.Chieh Chung, a military researcher at Taiwan's National Policy Foundation think tank, said the fleet would have trouble with that task, because China could position warships in the Pacific before launching an attack.But he added that the submarines could occupy strategic ambush points in the region and ""greatly harm (China's) combat ability"" by targeting high-value ships such as carrier groups or landing fleets.'GREAT HELP'Taiwan has quietly sourced technology, components and talent from at least seven nations to help it build submarines, a Reuters investigation has found. Getting foreign assistance was particularly challenging for Taiwan, which doesn't have official ties with most countries.Huang declined to say which countries had approved export permits, but said he had reached out to generals from countries that included the United States, Japan, South Korea and India.""For those foreign generals who agreed with my ideas, they helped convey the message to their governments or arrange meetings,"" he said. ""I told them our needs and that's how we achieved our purpose of securing export permits.""Huang also expressed thanks for the ""great help"" from a team led by an unnamed retired rear admiral of Britain's Royal Navy, who secured export permits from Britain through a Gibraltar-based company.Britain sharply increased the amount of submarine parts and technology exports approved last year for Taiwan, a Reuters analysis of the data showed. Huang described the program as ""even harder than reaching the sky,"" pointing to challenges such as a global chip shortage that hit many manufacturers around the world. He said his team scrambled to source chips from Taiwan to avoid delays by foreign vendors.A foreign supplier had also pull out at the last minute after the work with Taiwan was leaked to a Chinese embassy, he said, without elaborating.He said China's frequent military harassment, including close approaches to Taiwan's territorial waters and airspace, has prompted Taiwan and the United States to rethink the island's ""asymmetrical"" strategy of making its forces more mobile and harder to attack, with a focus on smaller weapons systems.""The American thinking is changing gradually. They realised that you can't withstand (the harassment) without bigger boats,"" Huang said, pointing to the navy's plan to build a new generation of bigger frigates.""They are getting closer and closer,"" he added, referring to China. ""Taiwan can't drive them out with small boats. We must use bigger boats.""($1 = 31.9840 Taiwan dollars)

1,Renault to maintain mixed ethanol combustion engines in Brazil By Reuters,"Published Sep 22, 2023 05:30PM ETUpdated Sep 22, 2023 05:36PM ET","Position added successfully to: 
SAO PAULO (Reuters) -  Renault  (EPA:RENA) will maintain production of ethanol-fueled combustion vehicles in Brazil, where nine in 10 cars are equipped to run on a mixture of gasoline and the biofuel as fully electric vehicles (EVs) need more government support, the head of the French carmaker's Brazil branch said on Friday.""It still pays to invest in combustion in Brazil,"" top executive Ricardo Gondo said at an event, adding that the industry will need more federal incentives to accelerate its EV transition.Renault is wrapping up a $2 billion reais (over $400 million) investment in the country which includes a new vehicle platform to be produced in its Parana state industrial complex, that would allow the company to produce combustion engines in the facilities and ""allow electrification"", Gondo said.Renault did not say when it plans to manufacture electric cars in Brazil, and the only one it sells in the country - its China-made Kwid model, which according to the country's EV trade association, sold only two vehicles last month.Renault is planning to launch Brazilian sales of an electric version of its French-made Kangoo van in October, when it will also launch its Kardian combustion engine SUV, set to be manufactured locally.While Gondo defended Renault's plans for a ""transition period"" for electrification in Brazil, rivals such as Chinese automakers BYD (SZ:002594), Great Wall Motor Co Ltd, Chery and JAC are disrupting traditional local manufactures with fully electric models sold in Brazil. ""The combustion engine will continue to see improvements in energy efficiency,"" Gondo said, adding that the government should adopt quotas for electric cars tax-free imports to protect local manufacturers that face highly equipped products imported from China that have competitive prices.Earlier this month, Renault CEO Luca de Meo warned a ""very competitive"" industry in China and that it will need to ""catch up fast"". The company is planning to spin-off its EV unit together with partners Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Nissan (OTC:NSANY).Meanwhile, the government of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has placed an emphasis on fighting climate change and reversing policies enacted by his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.($1 = 4.9256 reais)

2,"Even China's 1.4 billion population can't fill all its vacant homes, former official says By Reuters","Published Sep 23, 2023 07:38AM ETUpdated Sep 23, 2023 09:20AM ET","Position added successfully to: 
BEIJING (Reuters) - Even China's population of 1.4 billion would not be enough to fill all the empty apartments littered across the country, a former official said on Saturday, in a rare public critique of the country's crisis-hit property market. China's property sector, once the pillar of the economy, has slumped since 2021 when real estate giant China  Evergrande  (HK:3333) Group defaulted on its debt obligations following a clampdown on new borrowing. Big-name developers such as Country Garden Holdings continue to teeter close to default even to this day, keeping home-buyer sentiment depressed.As of the end of August, the combined floor area of unsold homes stood at 648 million square metres (7 billion square feet), the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show. That would be equal to 7.2 million homes, according to Reuters calculations, based on the average home size of 90 square metres.That does not count the numerous residential projects that have already been sold but not yet completed due to cash-flow problems, or the multiple homes purchased by speculators in the last market upturn in 2016 that remain vacant, which together make up the bulk of unused space, experts estimate.""How many vacant homes are there now? Each expert gives a very different number, with the most extreme believing the current number of vacant homes are enough for 3 billion people,"" said He Keng, 81, a former deputy head of the statistics bureau.""That estimate might be a bit much, but 1.4 billion people probably can't fill them,"" He said at a forum in the southern Chinese city Dongguan, according to a video released by the official media China News Service.His negative view of the economically significant sector at a public forum stands in sharp contrast to the official narrative that the Chinese economy is ""resilient"". ""All sorts of comments predicting the collapse of China's economy keep surfacing every now and then, but what has collapsed is such rhetoric, not China's economy,"" a spokesperson at the foreign ministry said at a recent news conference.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on Friday said it sued  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) for disability discrimination, alleging the delivery firm refused to hire deaf or hearing-impaired individuals as drivers.The agency said the Department of Transportation (DOT) has authorized the practice of employing those individuals to drive vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds through a program that exempts them from a hearing test and instead uses alternative criteria to ensure an equivalent level of driver safety. Atlanta-based UPS said it is modifying driver training for those who are deaf and hard of hearing and would start accepting exemptions to the DOT commercial driver hearing standard for operators of its ubiquitous brown delivery trucks in January 2024. UPS said training is necessary because ""current regulations do not consider best practices for driving larger commercial vehicles that make frequent stops in residential neighborhoods, or other significant factors UPS considers as it works to help keep its drivers and communities safe."" EEOC said it sued the world's largest parcel delivery firm under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) after failing to reach a pre-litigation settlement.""Just because someone is deaf does not mean they cannot drive safely,"" said Gregory Gochanour, EEOC's regional attorney in Chicago. The case, EEOC v. UPS, Civil Action No. 1:23-cv-14021, was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

4,Pennsylvania doubles Amtrak service with $200m infrastructure investment By Investing.com,"Published Sep 22, 2023 05:06PM ET","Position added successfully to: 
Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro announced an expansion of Amtrak's New York City-Harrisburg-Pittsburgh service on Friday, doubling its frequency from once to twice daily. The expansion is a result of an agreement between the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and  Norfolk Southern  Corporation (NYSE:NSC), and will be facilitated by a $200 million investment from the commonwealth.The agreement aims to enhance passenger rail service in Western Pennsylvania while preserving a critical freight rail corridor. ""This agreement lays the groundwork for expanded passenger rail service in Western Pennsylvania,"" said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. He further emphasized that the agreement would provide key mobility and economic benefits by reducing commute times, connecting hundreds of thousands of residents, and boosting local economies.The commonwealth's investment will be directed towards ""infrastructure and safety improvements"" built and maintained by Norfolk Southern. These include upgraded rail lines, sidings, and necessary communications signals infrastructure. PennDOT has also applied for grant funds through the Federal Railroad Administration to help finance these improvements.Supporters of the agreement believe it aligns with statewide aspirations for expanding passenger rail. Senator Wayne Langerholc, R-Clearfield and chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, praised the announcement, noting that it keeps Pennsylvania on course to achieving more rail service for western Pennsylvanians, a goal he prioritized upon election.In addition to serving more Pennsylvanians with modern, reliable passenger rail, this expansion is expected to connect Pennsylvania communities and stimulate job creation, economic development, and infrastructure investment. The move is seen as a win-win for business and passengers alike.In related developments across the state, the Schuylkill River Passenger Rail Authority in eastern Pennsylvania awaits news from the Federal Railroad Administration regarding a $500,000 grant to plan for a potential route between Philadelphia and Reading.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

5,Arm Holdings' debut on NYSE met with caution by analysts By Investing.com,"Published Sep 22, 2023 05:14PM ET"," Arm  Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), the chip-design company, made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) recently, experiencing an initial surge in share price before settling close to its listing price. However, financial analysts from Susquehanna Financial Group, Christopher Rolland and Mehdi Hosseini, have urged investors to exercise caution as they believe the company's stock is currently appropriately valued.On Friday, Arm Holdings' shares fell by 1.7% to $51.32, a significant decrease from their peak of over $60 per share reached shortly after the company's initial public offering (IPO). The IPO was priced at $51 a share.Rolland and Hosseini initiated their coverage of Arm with a neutral rating, setting a share-price target of $48. This target was calculated based on an enterprise value that is 15 times Arm's forecast sales for 2024. Despite the company's role in advancing artificial intelligence (AI), the analysts identified several challenges that might affect its market performance.The primary concern raised by the analysts is the sluggish growth in mobile handsets, currently the largest market for Arm's chip designs. They suggested that these circumstances might necessitate Arm to increase its royalty rates and diversify into new sectors in order to justify its premium valuation.The analysts also pointed out potential risks associated with expanding royalty rates for core customers and margin contraction linked to additional revenue streams. As a result of these factors, Rolland and Hosseini concluded that Arm Holdings should trade at a valuation discount compared to its stock performance over the past decade.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

By David Shepardson and Joseph WhiteDETROIT (Reuters) -The United Auto Workers expanded its strikes against Detroit automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), but kept its Ford (NYSE:F) walkout limited to a single plant due to progress made in talks, the union said on Friday. The auto workers' union began strikes at noon EDT (1600 GMT) on Friday against 38 parts distribution centers across the United States at GM and Stellantis, extending its unprecedented, simultaneous strikes that began with one assembly plant each of the Detroit Three. The additional facilities added about 5,600 workers to the 12,700 already on strike.UAW President Shawn Fain said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:META) live event that by targeting distribution centers the strike becomes a nationwide event. He said he expected talks to continue through the weekend.Hours after Fain invited President Joe Biden to visit a picket line, Biden said in a social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he would come to Michigan on Tuesday ""to join the picket line and stand in solidarity with the men and women of UAW."" He added: ""It’s time for a win-win agreement that keeps American auto manufacturing thriving with well-paid UAW jobs."" The president has been vocal in his support for the union's demands for better pay and benefits. Former President Donald Trump, who is seeking a new term, will be in Michigan on Wednesday to address auto workers, his campaign said.Fain said the decision on the expanded strike would impact consumers trying to obtain repair parts. The distribution centers are warehouses that ship parts to dealers and other retailers for use in repairs. ""We will be everywhere from California to Massachusetts, from Oregon to Florida."" At a GM parts distribution center outside Philadelphia, picketing workers said the strike will result in cars sitting longer for repairs but that is the only way to get the higher wages they seek.""If you look at the past few years, car prices went up 30% but our wages went up 6%. We are not the problem,"" said Thomas Morris, 60, who has worked at the center in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, for the past four decades. ""I understand it’s going to cost some pain for people, but we are just looking for fairness.""Fain said they have more work to do at Ford, but ""we do want to recognize that Ford is showing they're serious about reaching a deal."" He added: ""Stellantis and GM in particular are going to need some serious pushing."" He also threatened more action at Stellantis' critical parts plants in his hometown of Kokomo, Indiana. Stellantis has four factories in Kokomo that make engines and transmissions used widely across the automaker's product line. Stellantis has said it wants to be able to consolidate and close some of its parts distribution centers.Fain said Ford had improved its contract offer, including boosting profit sharing and agreeing to let workers strike over plant closures but said the union still has ""serious issues"" with Ford. GM said in a statement that UAW leaders are ""manipulating the bargaining process for their own personal agendas"" and called the strike escalation ""unnecessary."" Stellantis said on Thursday it made a ""very competitive offer"" and said the union's leadership seems ""more concerned about pursuing their own political agendas.""GM, which said it had contingency plans it did not specify to protect its business and customers, said it has made five separate offers to the union.Ford said it is continuing to negotiate, adding that ""we have more work ahead of us before we can reach an agreement."" Nearly 13,000 UAW workers walked out at plants in Missouri, Michigan and Ohio on Sept 15. Those plants produce the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, alongside other popular models. But Ford and Canadian union Unifor reached a last-minute deal to avoid a walkout on Tuesday. Unifor's Ford leadership unanimously endorsed the tentative agreement late on Friday. Ratification meetings for members were set for Saturday, Unifor said.Wedbush Analyst Daniel Ives said this latest move by the UAW marks a divergence in the talks with the automakers.""The current deal is a torpedo to the business models of the Detroit 3,"" he said. ""To take a deal just to avoid a strike and get it done is great for the next 24 hours but a nightmare for the next 30 years.""Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said Ford's family-controlled structure gives it a different focus than the other two. ""GM and Stellantis are looking at stockholder value and Ford is looking a lot more long-term that they have to make friends with labor."" The standoff is fueling worries about prolonged industrial action that could disrupt production and dent U.S. economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers.The automakers have proposed 20% raises over 4-1/2 years, while the UAW is seeking 40%.The union also wants to eliminate wage gaps separating newer and older employees, as well as workers in certain component operations and those in assembly plants. Fain said on Friday that the union had negotiated the elimination of lower wage tiers in some components facilities at Ford and GM. But Stellantis has not agreed to raise wages at its MOPAR component operations, Fain said.

By Hadeel Al Sayegh(Reuters) - Spinneys Dubai LLC, the franchisee of the supermarket chain in the United Arab Emirates and Oman, is planning an initial public offering of the business in the second quarter of 2024, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.Albwardy Investment, the franchise's 100% owner, hired Rothschild & Co to advise on the planned IPO, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the plans are not public.It invited banks this week to pitch for roles in the offering, expected to be up to 30% of the company, the sources added.Spinneys, Albwardy and Rothschild did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.The potential IPO of Spinneys Dubai, planned on the Dubai Financial Market, would add to the small but growing regional food retail sector.Americana Restaurants, the Middle East and North Africa franchisee of fast food restaurants KFC and Pizza Hut, as well as a seller of frozen foods, debuted in a dual listing in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh in December.Lulu Group, a hypermarket and mall operator, expects its IPO in the first half of 2024, its chairman said earlier this month, adding that it hired Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co to advise it, confirming an October 2022 Reuters report.IPO activity in the Gulf is expected to pick up after the pace slowed from an exceptional 2022, when Saudi Arabia and the UAE led new listings, raising nearly $22 billion - more than half the total for the wider Europe, Middle East and Africa region, Dealogic data shows.Middle Eastern companies still raised $5.3 billion in the first half of this year through 23 market debuts.Spinneys Dubai operates more than 65 stores across the UAE, its website says. In addition, it operates at least seven stores in Oman, Albwardy's website says.Albwardy, which says it has annual turnover above $1 billion, also owns the franchise rights to upmarket British supermarket chain Waitrose.Founded in the mid-1970s, it has a hospitality portfolio that includes several Four Seasons hotels and food distribution investments that include Nestle UAE.Other sectors in Albwardy's portfolio are industrial and engineering, commercial and insurance, agribusiness and properties.

8,US Supreme Court extends pause on order curbing Biden social media contacts By Reuters,"Published Sep 22, 2023 04:28PM ETUpdated Sep 22, 2023 05:05PM ET","By Nate Raymond and Andrew Chung(Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Friday extended a temporary block on an order restricting the ability of President Joe Biden's administration to encourage social media companies to remove content it deemed misinformation about COVID-19 and other matters of public concern.The decision to keep the matter on hold until Wednesday gives the court more time to consider the administration's request to block an injunction issued by a lower court that had concluded that federal officials likely had violated the free speech protections of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment by coercing social media platforms into censoring certain posts.Alito's order pauses the dispute until Sept. 27 at 11:59 p.m. EDT. He had previously halted the lower court's rulingthrough Sept. 22. Alito is the justice designated by the court to act on certain matters arising from a group of states that include Louisiana, where the lawsuit was first filed.The Republican attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana and a group of social media users sued federal officials, accusing them of unlawfully helping suppress conservative-leaning constitutionally protected speech on major social medial platforms.Those platforms included Meta's Facebook (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube and X, formerly called Twitter. Many of the posts expressed opinions that federal officials said constituted misinformation about the pandemic.The Biden administration argued that officials did nothing illegal and had sought to mitigate the hazards of online misinformation by alerting social media companies to content that violated their own policies.Louisiana-based U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty in July concluded that government officials had coercively pressured the companies to suppress posts by users that expressed views that were against COVID-19 vaccines, pandemic-related lockdowns intended as public health measures or that questioned the results of the 2020 election in which Biden, a Democrat, defeated Donald Trump, a Republican.The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated much of an injunction that Doughty issued restricting the administration's social media communications, with the exception of a provision concerning coercion, which they narrowed.The narrowed injunction applied to the White House, the surgeon general, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FBI, saying they could not ""coerce or significantly encourage"" the companies to remove content.The administration told the Supreme Court that the remaining injunction still went too far and would interfere with how the White House, FBI and health officials address matters of public concern and security.

(Reuters) -U.S. government services would be disrupted and hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed without pay if Congress fails to provide funding for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Workers deemed ""essential"" would remain on the job, but without pay.Many government agencies have not updated shutdown plans they have prepared in the past. Here is a guide to what would stay open and what would shut down:MILITARYThe 2 million U.S. military personnel would remain at their posts, but roughly half of the Pentagon's 800,000 civilian employees would be furloughed.Contracts awarded before the shutdown would continue, and the Pentagon could place new orders for supplies or services needed to protect national security. Other new contracts, including renewals or extensions, would not be awarded. Payments to defense contractors such as Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and RTX, formerly known as Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), could be delayed.The Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration would continue maintaining nuclear weapons.LAW ENFORCEMENTAccording to the Justice Department's 2021 contingency plan, agents at the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other federal law enforcement agencies would remain on the job, and prison staffers would continue to work.Criminal prosecutions, including the two federal cases against former President Donald Trump, would continue. Most civil litigation would be postponed.Aid to local police departments and other grants could be delayed.Border Patrol and immigration enforcement agents would continue to work, as would customs officers, according to the Department of Homeland Security's 2022 plan. The Secret Service and the Coast Guard would also continue operations.Most of the Federal Trade Commission's consumer-protection workers would be furloughed, as would half of its antitrust employees.FEDERAL COURTSFederal courts have enough money to stay open until at least Oct. 13. Activities might be scaled back after that point. The Supreme Court would stay open as well.TRANSPORTATIONAirport security screeners and air-traffic control workers would be required to work, according to recent contingency plans, though absenteeism could be a problem. Some airports had to suspend operations during a shutdown in 2019 when traffic controllers called in sick.Training for new air traffic controllers would stop, which Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has warned could worsen a shortage of qualified workers.Some major infrastructure projects could face delays as environmental reviews and permitting would be disrupted, according to the White House.FOREIGN AFFAIRSU.S. embassies and consulates would remain open under the State Department's 2022 shutdown plan. Passport and visa processing would continue as long as there were sufficient fees to cover operations. Nonessential official travel, speeches and other events would be curtailed.Some foreign aid programs could run out of money as well.NATIONAL PARKS AND NATURAL RESOURCESIt's not clear how national parks, national monuments and other sites would be affected. Many remained open during a 2018-2019 shutdown, through restrooms and information desks were closed and waste disposal was halted. They were closed during a 2013 shutdown.Wildfire fighting efforts would continue, according to the Agriculture Department's 2020 contingency plan, though timber sales on national forest lands would be curtailed and fewer recreation permits would be issued.SCIENCEScientific research would be disrupted as agencies like the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) would furlough most of their workers, according to recent contingency plans.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) would continue to support the International Space Station and track satellites, but 17,000 of its 18,300 employees would be furloughed.Weather forecasts and fisheries regulation would continue, as would patent and trademark reviews. Tests of new drugs and medical devices would continue.HEALTHThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would continue to monitor disease outbreaks, though other public health activities could suffer as more than half of the agency's workers would be furloughed.The National Institutes of Health would furlough most of its staff and delay new clinical trials for medical treatments.Healthcare services for veterans and Native Americans would continue.Most inspections of hazardous waste sites and drinking water and chemical facilities would stop.Food-safety inspections by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could be delayed.FINANCIAL REGULATIONThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would furlough roughly 90% of its 4,600 employees and suspend most activities, leaving only a skeleton staff to respond to emergencies.Likewise, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) would furlough almost all of its employees and cease oversight, enforcement and regulation, according to its 2021 plan.The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would continue as normal, as they are funded by industry fees rather than congressional appropriations.ECONOMIC DATAImportant economic data reports from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics would be suspended, including the monthly unemployment report, due out on Oct. 6, and price reports due the following week. Reports from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Census Bureau could be suspended as well, including retail sales and housing starts.SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND OTHER BENEFITSThe Social Security Administration would continue to issue retirement and disability benefits, and payments would continue under the Medicare and Medicaid health programs.Military veterans' benefits would also continue, according to a 2021 contingency plan.Food assistance administered through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could be affected, as grocery stores would not be able to renew their licenses.TAX COLLECTIONThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would operate as normal, and all 83,000 employees would continue to be paid because the agency's funding would not expire.DISASTER RESPONSEThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would risk running out of funds for disaster relief and long-term recovery projects.EDUCATIONPell Grants and student loans would continue to be paid, but could be disrupted as most Education Department employees would be furloughed, according to the agency's 2021 plan.A protracted shutdown could ""severely curtail"" aid to schools, universities and other educational institutions, the department says.

Asian stock markets are preparing for a cautious commencement to the week today, as investors evaluate the potential impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy stance. Japanese futures remained steady on Sunday, while Australian futures and Hong Kong stock contracts experienced slight declines. In contrast, an index of U.S.-listed Chinese companies saw an increase, following the announcement that Washington and Beijing are setting up working groups to discuss economic and financial matters.In early Monday trading in Asia, S&P 500 futures rose by 0.2%, recovering from Friday's equivalent fall that marked its poorest week since March. Nasdaq 100 futures also increased by 0.2%, buoyed by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).'s latest product sales which contributed to the stability of the underlying index on Friday.The upcoming week will see U.S. Treasuries once again under scrutiny due to scheduled public appearances by Federal Reserve officials. Investors are also awaiting key U.S. inflation data and assessing the potential implications of a possible U.S. government shutdown.According to market analyst Fawad Razaqzada from City Index and Forex.com, traders remain wary about inflation and policy direction in light of the recent oil surge and the Fed's hint that interest rates will not decrease in the near future.Two Federal Reserve officials suggested last week that at least one more rate hike could be forthcoming, with borrowing costs potentially needing to stay high for a longer period for inflation to return to its 2% target. Boston Fed President Susan Collins did not rule out further tightening, while Governor Michelle Bowman suggested that more than one increase might be necessary, reinforcing her status as one of the Federal Open Market Committee's most hawkish members.San Francisco Fed Bank President Mary Daly stated last week that it is premature to claim victory over inflation, reaffirming the central bank's continued commitment to manage price pressures as smoothly as possible.Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)'s rate strategists predict that the yield on 10-year Treasuries could reach 4.75% before softer risk sentiment and tighter financial conditions drive it down by year-end.In other market news, oil prices are approaching their annual high, while Bitcoin remained steady around $26,500.The week ahead is packed with key events including speeches by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and ECB's Francois Villeroy de Galhau on Monday. This will be followed by the release of U.S. new home sales data and Conference Board consumer confidence on Tuesday, with ECB's Philip Lane also scheduled to speak.

(Reuters) -U.S. government services would be disrupted and hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed without pay if Congress fails to provide funding for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Workers deemed ""essential"" would remain on the job, but without pay.Many government agencies have not updated shutdown plans they have prepared in the past. Here is a guide to what would stay open and what would shut down:MILITARYThe 2 million U.S. military personnel would remain at their posts, but roughly half of the Pentagon's 800,000 civilian employees would be furloughed.Contracts awarded before the shutdown would continue, and the Pentagon could place new orders for supplies or services needed to protect national security. Other new contracts, including renewals or extensions, would not be awarded. Payments to defense contractors such as Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and RTX, formerly known as Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), could be delayed.The Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration would continue maintaining nuclear weapons.LAW ENFORCEMENTAccording to the Justice Department's 2021 contingency plan, agents at the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other federal law enforcement agencies would remain on the job, and prison staffers would continue to work.Criminal prosecutions, including the two federal cases against former President Donald Trump, would continue. Most civil litigation would be postponed.Aid to local police departments and other grants could be delayed.Border Patrol and immigration enforcement agents would continue to work, as would customs officers, according to the Department of Homeland Security's 2022 plan. The Secret Service and the Coast Guard would also continue operations.Most of the Federal Trade Commission's consumer-protection workers would be furloughed, as would half of its antitrust employees.FEDERAL COURTSFederal courts have enough money to stay open until at least Oct. 13. Activities might be scaled back after that point. The Supreme Court would stay open as well.TRANSPORTATIONAirport security screeners and air-traffic control workers would be required to work, according to recent contingency plans, though absenteeism could be a problem. Some airports had to suspend operations during a shutdown in 2019 when traffic controllers called in sick.Training for new air traffic controllers would stop, which Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has warned could worsen a shortage of qualified workers.Some major infrastructure projects could face delays as environmental reviews and permitting would be disrupted, according to the White House.FOREIGN AFFAIRSU.S. embassies and consulates would remain open under the State Department's 2022 shutdown plan. Passport and visa processing would continue as long as there were sufficient fees to cover operations. Nonessential official travel, speeches and other events would be curtailed.Some foreign aid programs could run out of money as well.NATIONAL PARKS AND NATURAL RESOURCESIt's not clear how national parks, national monuments and other sites would be affected. Many remained open during a 2018-2019 shutdown, through restrooms and information desks were closed and waste disposal was halted. They were closed during a 2013 shutdown.Wildfire fighting efforts would continue, according to the Agriculture Department's 2020 contingency plan, though timber sales on national forest lands would be curtailed and fewer recreation permits would be issued.SCIENCEScientific research would be disrupted as agencies like the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) would furlough most of their workers, according to recent contingency plans.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) would continue to support the International Space Station and track satellites, but 17,000 of its 18,300 employees would be furloughed.Weather forecasts and fisheries regulation would continue, as would patent and trademark reviews. Tests of new drugs and medical devices would continue.HEALTHThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would continue to monitor disease outbreaks, though other public health activities could suffer as more than half of the agency's workers would be furloughed.The National Institutes of Health would furlough most of its staff and delay new clinical trials for medical treatments.Healthcare services for veterans and Native Americans would continue.Most inspections of hazardous waste sites and drinking water and chemical facilities would stop.Food-safety inspections by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could be delayed.FINANCIAL REGULATIONThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would furlough roughly 90% of its 4,600 employees and suspend most activities, leaving only a skeleton staff to respond to emergencies.Likewise, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) would furlough almost all of its employees and cease oversight, enforcement and regulation, according to its 2021 plan.The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would continue as normal, as they are funded by industry fees rather than congressional appropriations.ECONOMIC DATAImportant economic data reports from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics would be suspended, including the monthly unemployment report, due out on Oct. 6, and price reports due the following week. Reports from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Census Bureau could be suspended as well, including retail sales and housing starts.SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND OTHER BENEFITSThe Social Security Administration would continue to issue retirement and disability benefits, and payments would continue under the Medicare and Medicaid health programs.Military veterans' benefits would also continue, according to a 2021 contingency plan.Food assistance administered through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could be affected, as grocery stores would not be able to renew their licenses.TAX COLLECTIONThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would operate as normal, and all 83,000 employees would continue to be paid because the agency's funding would not expire.DISASTER RESPONSEThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would risk running out of funds for disaster relief and long-term recovery projects.EDUCATIONPell Grants and student loans would continue to be paid, but could be disrupted as most Education Department employees would be furloughed, according to the agency's 2021 plan.A protracted shutdown could ""severely curtail"" aid to schools, universities and other educational institutions, the department says. It also could delay funds that are due to be awarded later in the year.CHILD CAREAccording to the White House, 10,000 children from low-income families would lose access to the Head Start preschool program.SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORTThe Small Business Administration would not be able to issue any new loans, though loans for businesses hurt by natural disasters would continue.LABORWorkplace safety inspections would be limited and investigations into unfair pay practices would be suspended, according to the White House.The ability of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to mediate labor disputes would be curtailed because almost all of its 1,200 employees would be furloughed, according to a 2022 plan.WHITE HOUSEIn the 2018-2019 shutdown, the White House furloughed 1,100 of 1,800 staff in the Executive Office of the President.

By Hadeel Al Sayegh(Reuters) - Spinneys Dubai LLC, the franchisee of the supermarket chain in the United Arab Emirates and Oman, is planning an initial public offering of the business in the second quarter of 2024, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.Albwardy Investment, the franchise's 100% owner, hired Rothschild & Co to advise on the planned IPO, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the plans are not public.It invited banks this week to pitch for roles in the offering, expected to be up to 30% of the company, the sources added.Spinneys, Albwardy and Rothschild did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.The potential IPO of Spinneys Dubai, planned on the Dubai Financial Market, would add to the small but growing regional food retail sector.Americana Restaurants, the Middle East and North Africa franchisee of fast food restaurants KFC and Pizza Hut, as well as a seller of frozen foods, debuted in a dual listing in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh in December.Lulu Group, a hypermarket and mall operator, expects its IPO in the first half of 2024, its chairman said earlier this month, adding that it hired Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co to advise it, confirming an October 2022 Reuters report.IPO activity in the Gulf is expected to pick up after the pace slowed from an exceptional 2022, when Saudi Arabia and the UAE led new listings, raising nearly $22 billion - more than half the total for the wider Europe, Middle East and Africa region, Dealogic data shows.Middle Eastern companies still raised $5.3 billion in the first half of this year through 23 market debuts.Spinneys Dubai operates more than 65 stores across the UAE, its website says. In addition, it operates at least seven stores in Oman, Albwardy's website says.Albwardy, which says it has annual turnover above $1 billion, also owns the franchise rights to upmarket British supermarket chain Waitrose.Founded in the mid-1970s, it has a hospitality portfolio that includes several Four Seasons hotels and food distribution investments that include Nestle UAE.Other sectors in Albwardy's portfolio are industrial and engineering, commercial and insurance, agribusiness and properties.

By Zeba Siddiqui and Raphael SatterSAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About a year ago, the U.S. security firm Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) began to hear from a flurry of companies that had been hacked in ways that weren't the norm for cybercriminals. Native English-speaking hackers would call up a target company’s information technology helpdesk posing as an employee, and seek login details by pretending to have lost theirs. They had all the employee information needed to sound convincing. And once they got access, they’d quickly find their way into the company's most sensitive repositories to steal that data for extortion.Ransomware attacks are not new, but this group was extraordinarily skilled at social engineering and bypassing multi-factor authentication, said Wendi Whitmore, senior vice president for the security firm Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team, which has responded to several intrusions tied to the group.""They are much more sophisticated than many cybercriminal actors. They appear to be disciplined and organized in their attacks,"" she said. ""And that's something we typically see more frequently with nation-state actors, versus cyber criminals.""Known in the security industry variously as Scattered Spider, Muddled Libra, and UNC3944, these hackers were thrust into the limelight earlier this month for breaching the systems of two of the world's largest gambling companies - MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) and Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment Ltd.Behind the scenes, it has hit many more companies, according to analysts tracking the intrusions - and cybersecurity specialists expect the attacks to continue. The FBI is investigating the MGM and Caesars breaches, and the companies did not comment on who may be behind them.From Canada to Japan, the security firm CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has tracked 52 attacks globally by the group since March 2022, most of them in the United States, said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of threat intelligence at the company. Google-owned intelligence firm Mandiant, has logged more than 100 intrusions by it in the last two years. Nearly every industry, from telecommunications to finance, hospitality, and media, has been hit. Reuters was not able to determine how much money the hackers may have extorted.But it's not just the scale or the breadth of attacks that make this group stand out. They're extremely good at what they do and ""ruthless"" in their interactions with victims, said Kevin Mandia, Mandiant's founder.The speed at which they breach and exfiltrate data from company systems can overwhelm security response teams, and they have left threatening notes for staff of victim organizations on their systems, and contacted them by text and email in the past, Mandiant found.In some cases - Mandia did not say which ones - hackers tied to Scattered Spider placed bogus emergency calls to summon heavily armed police units to the homes of executives of targeted companies. The technique, called SWATing, ""is something that’s utterly dreadful to live through as a victim,"" he said. ""I don’t even think these intrusions are about money. I think they’re about power, influence and notoriety. That makes it harder to respond to.""Reuters couldn't immediately reach the hacking group for comment. 17-22 YEAR OLDS There's little detail on Scattered Spider's location or identity. Based on the criminals’ chats with victims and clues gleaned from breach investigations, CrowdStrike's Meyers said they are largely 17-22 years-olds. Mandiant estimates they’re mainly from Western countries, but it's unclear how many people are involved. Before calling helpdesks, the hackers acquire employee information including passwords by social engineering, especially 'SIM swapping' - a technique where they trick a telecom company's customer service representative to reassign a specific phone number from one device to another, analysts say.They also appear to make the effort to study how large organizations work, including their vendors and contractors, to find individuals with privileged access they can target, according to analysts. That’s something David Bradbury, chief security officer of the identity management firm Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), saw first-hand last month, when he discovered multiple Okta customers – including MGM – breached by Scattered Spider. Okta provides identity services such as multi-factor authentication used to help users securely access online applications and websites.""The threat actors have clearly taken our courses that we provide online, they've clearly studied our product and how it works,"" Bradbury said. ""This is stuff we haven't seen before."" A larger group named ALPHV said last week it was behind the MGM hack, and analysts believe it provided the software and attack tools for the operation to be carried out by Scattered Spider. Such collaborations are typical for cybercriminals, said Okta's Bradbury. ALPHV, which according to Mandiant is a ""ransomware-as-a-service"", would provide services such as a helpdesk, webpage and branding, and in turn get a cut of whatever Scattered Spider would make from the hack. While many ransomware attacks go unpublicised, the MGM hack was a vivid example of the real-world impact of such incidents. It caused chaos in Las Vegas, as gaming machines stalled and hotel systems were disrupted. Ransomware gangs often function like large organizations, and continue to evolve their methods to adapt to the latest security measures organizations use. ""In some ways this is just like the age-old game of cat and mouse,"" said Whitmore, who compared Scattered Spider to Lapsus$, another group behind previous hacks into Okta and the technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The British police last year arrested seven people between the ages of 16 and 21 following those hacks.

X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Gupta's tenure at X ended in September, according to Gupta's LinkedIn profile, which said he ""enabled transition leadership for Twitter post acquisition by Elon Musk led X-Corp."" He had joined the company in February, 2022, eight months before Musk completed his $44 billion acquisition of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). X counts India as a key market, with around 27 million users. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other government officials are regular users of the platform.There are roughly 15 X employees in functions like compliance and engineering in India, said one of the sources, but Gupta was the only executive engaging with the government and political parties.Interaction between X and government and party officials would intensify typically during the run up to polls, and a national election is due to take place in India next year.X is appealing against an Indian court ruling that it had failed to comply with government orders to remove certain content, arguing it could embolden New Delhi to block more content and broaden the scope for censorship.India in September told a court X is a ""habitual non-compliant platform"" and for years has not followed many orders to remove content, undermining the government's role.

16,Explainer-What you need to know about RSV and the new vaccines By Reuters,"Published Sep 22, 2023 02:18PM ETUpdated Sep 22, 2023 05:33PM ET","Position added successfully to: 
By Michael Erman(Reuters) -The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday recommended  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for women in the middle of the third trimester of pregnancy to protect their babies from severe illness.That Pfizer shot and one developed by GSK in May became the first two RSV vaccines to win U.S. approval, for use in people aged 60 and over to prevent severe illness. In August, Pfizer's vaccine also won approval for the maternal use. Here's what you need to know. What is RSV? RSV is a usually seasonal respiratory virus that generally causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Still, infants and older adults have a higher risk of developing severe RSV.RSV leads to 58,000 to 80,000 hospitalizations among children under age 5, and 60,000 to 160,000 hospitalizations among adults age 65 and older each year, according to the CDC. It causes around 14,000 deaths in adults aged 65 and older in the U.S. annually, according to government estimates. Who should get the vaccines?The U.S. CDC has recommended that adults aged 60 or older may get the shot after discussions with a healthcare provider about whether RSV vaccination is right for them. The agency stopped short of saying all adults over the age of 60 should receive it this year.Outside advisers to the CDC suggested the narrower recommendation in June after expressing concern that there was not sufficient data on how effective the vaccines are in people over age 75 and in other high-risk groups.CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen formally recommended use of the vaccine in expecting mothers to protect infants up to age 6 months after the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 11-1 in its favor. The panel recommended use of the shot in women 32 weeks to 36 weeks into their pregnancy from September to January, in order to protect babies born in peak RSV season.How often do I need to get the vaccine to stay protected?Early data suggests that the RSV shots are protective for at least two years, but it is not yet clear how often older adults will need to be revaccinated. CDC advisers will consider the frequency of revaccination when more data becomes available.What else is available to protect infants from RSV?In July, the FDA also approved Beyfortus, a long-acting antibody therapy from  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) and partner AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), to prevent RSV in children up to 24 months of age.Previously, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum's Synagis was the only approved preventive therapy in the U.S. for high-risk infants. Synagis is given as monthly injections, while Beyfortus can be given annually.Are RSV cases on the rise?Yes, although not alarmingly so. Detection of the virus in testing has increased significantly over the last month to around the same levels as this spring, according to CDC data. Still, that is a fraction of the positive tests recorded at the same time a year ago, when RSV cases were surging around the country and hospitals were running out of pediatric beds.Can I get the RSV shot alongside my COVID and flu shots?Yes, current CDC guidelines allow for all three vaccines to be administered simultaneously, even though they have not been tested together.""If it's now or never again, it's best to get all the vaccines you're eligible for to get the protection against as many diseases as possible,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, a member of the board of directors for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. ""If you've got the luxury of returning for more than one visit, you can choose to space them out."" Will my insurance cover it?Adults who are insured under the U.S. Medicare program for people aged 65 and older or disabled are covered for the vaccine. Many private insurance plans, including large insurers like CVS Health (NYSE:CVS)'s Aetna, Humana (NYSE:HUM) and Elevance, which owns Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers including Anthem, also say they are covering the shot for adults 60 and older who are not yet eligible for Medicare.

17,US Supreme Court extends pause on order curbing Biden social media contacts By Reuters,"Published Sep 22, 2023 04:28PM ETUpdated Sep 22, 2023 05:05PM ET","By Nate Raymond and Andrew Chung(Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Friday extended a temporary block on an order restricting the ability of President Joe Biden's administration to encourage social media companies to remove content it deemed misinformation about COVID-19 and other matters of public concern.The decision to keep the matter on hold until Wednesday gives the court more time to consider the administration's request to block an injunction issued by a lower court that had concluded that federal officials likely had violated the free speech protections of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment by coercing social media platforms into censoring certain posts.Alito's order pauses the dispute until Sept. 27 at 11:59 p.m. EDT. He had previously halted the lower court's rulingthrough Sept. 22. Alito is the justice designated by the court to act on certain matters arising from a group of states that include Louisiana, where the lawsuit was first filed.The Republican attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana and a group of social media users sued federal officials, accusing them of unlawfully helping suppress conservative-leaning constitutionally protected speech on major social medial platforms.Those platforms included Meta's Facebook (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube and X, formerly called Twitter. Many of the posts expressed opinions that federal officials said constituted misinformation about the pandemic.The Biden administration argued that officials did nothing illegal and had sought to mitigate the hazards of online misinformation by alerting social media companies to content that violated their own policies.Louisiana-based U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty in July concluded that government officials had coercively pressured the companies to suppress posts by users that expressed views that were against COVID-19 vaccines, pandemic-related lockdowns intended as public health measures or that questioned the results of the 2020 election in which Biden, a Democrat, defeated Donald Trump, a Republican.The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated much of an injunction that Doughty issued restricting the administration's social media communications, with the exception of a provision concerning coercion, which they narrowed.The narrowed injunction applied to the White House, the surgeon general, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FBI, saying they could not ""coerce or significantly encourage"" the companies to remove content.The administration told the Supreme Court that the remaining injunction still went too far and would interfere with how the White House, FBI and health officials address matters of public concern and security.

Boston Fed President Susan Collins did not rule out further tightening, while Governor Michelle Bowman suggested that more than one increase might be necessary, reinforcing her status as one of the Federal Open Market Committee's most hawkish members.San Francisco Fed Bank President Mary Daly stated last week that it is premature to claim victory over inflation, reaffirming the central bank's continued commitment to manage price pressures as smoothly as possible.Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)'s rate strategists predict that the yield on 10-year Treasuries could reach 4.75% before softer risk sentiment and tighter financial conditions drive it down by year-end.In other market news, oil prices are approaching their annual high, while Bitcoin remained steady around $26,500.The week ahead is packed with key events including speeches by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and ECB's Francois Villeroy de Galhau on Monday. This will be followed by the release of U.S. new home sales data and Conference Board consumer confidence on Tuesday, with ECB's Philip Lane also scheduled to speak.

20,Exclusive-Germany scraps plans for more stringent building standards to prop up industry By Reuters,"Published Sep 24, 2023 06:04PM ET","By Christian KraemerBERLIN (Reuters) - The German government will put on indefinite hold plans to require more stringent building insulation standards, environment minister Robert Habeck told Reuters, an effort to help prop up the ailing building industry.The about-face from the German government comes ahead of a closely watched meeting between the building industry and government leaders with Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday to address a major slump in the sector.Abolition of the insulation standards has been a top demand of industry, which says the measures are too expensive and put a further damper on the depressed construction industry.""High interest rates and inflation are a heavy burden for the construction industry,"" Habeck told Reuters, noting that the insulation measures now ""can wait"".""I don't see this new standard being introduced in this legislative period,"" he said. The period runs until late 2025.For years, low interest rates fuelled a global boom, igniting interest in German property, seen as safe and stable as the country. A sharp rise in rates put an end to the run, tipping a string of developers into insolvency as deals froze and prices fell.German housing prices fell by the most since records began in the second quarter, the latest grim sign for the property market in Europe's largest economy, government data showed on Friday.Also last week, data showed that building permits for apartments in Germany fell 31.5% in July from a year earlier, highlighting a slump in demand plaguing the construction and real estate industry.Germany, whose population has recently grown as millions flock to the country, aims to build 400,000 apartments a year, but has struggled.Weakness in commercial real estate in the United States as offices remain empty after the pandemic and the unravelling in Sweden of one of the country's biggest landlords have globally called attention to distress in the sector. China has also seen major property builders struggle.In the weeks ahead of Monday's summit, the industry has been calling on the government for an aid package. Among other measures, industry leaders are asking for an abolition of a sales tax on property transactions and a government-backed credit program to help borrowers offset high interest rates.

He said, you strike, you're fired. Simple concept to me. ... To the extent that we can use that once again, absolutely.""Scott doubled down on Friday after the complaint against him and said UAW ""is one of the most corrupt and scandal-plagued unions"" in the United States. ""They want to threaten me & shut me up. They don't scare me,"" he said on messaging platform X.CONTEXT* The United Auto Workers expanded its strikes against Detroit automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), but kept its Ford (NYSE:F) walkout limited to a single plant due to progress made in talks, the union said on Friday.* The auto workers' union began strikes at noon ET (1600 GMT) on Friday against 38 parts distribution centers across the United States at GM and Stellantis, extending its unprecedented, simultaneous strikes that began with one assembly plant at each of the Detroit Three. The additional facilities added about 5,600 workers to the 12,700 already on strike.* The automakers have proposed 20% raises over 4-1/2 years, while the UAW is seeking 40%.

Wells Fargo, a leading banking institution, upgraded  Charter Communications ' (NASDAQ:CHTR) shares to overweight from equal weight on Friday. The bank also increased the price target for Charter's stock to $550 from $450, suggesting a potential 23% gain. Despite facing challenges in the cable industry due to increasing prices and the growing popularity of streaming services, Charter's stock has rallied by 31.8% this year.Analyst Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo attributed this positive outlook for Charter to its advantageous debt structure and expanding sports content. He highlighted that these factors would bolster Charter's market share in the streaming industry over the long term. Cahall stated, ""The worst of Cable is behind it, and CHTR is the clearest expression of the new normal. It has a strong converged bundle with Spectrum One, stable net adds due to its expansion in rural and a more aggressive video posture with programmers.""Charter's growth prospects, particularly in rural areas, also played a significant role in the rating uplift. The company's CEO Christopher Winfrey declared during a second-quarter earnings call in late July that Charter is currently the largest and fastest-growing rural provider in the nation.Furthermore, CFO Jessica Fischer emphasized that their rural construction initiative is disbursing at a steadier pace than in past years. This consistent spending strategy comes as the company reported an improvement in customer losses in its second quarter compared to the previous year.Charter's Spectrum One bundle offering, introduced in October 2022, is another factor contributing to its positive outlook. Cahall believes that if Charter can achieve strong conversion rates with Spectrum One, it could generate high-margin revenue that enhances EBITDA.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The airline has also warned of a shut down due to the crisis.India mandates a notice period of 6-12 months for pilots which some pilot organisations are challenging in court. Akasa argues its contractual obligations with pilots remain in force, and is suing the regulator for not intervening in the public interest.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the aviation ministry in a Sept. 22 filing at the Delhi High Court said Akasa's plea should be thrown out as the regulator is unable to interfere in the matter.The DGCA ""does not have any power or delegated authority to interfere in any employment contract,"" it said.Akasa, which has previously said it was in discussion with the DGCA, did not respond to a request for comment on the new filing, which has been seen by Reuters.

Historical patterns, including election year cycles and ten-year cycles, suggest that the final quarter of the year could see a robust performance.Notably, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has demonstrated a highly seasonal pattern during the fall season. A monthly expected return histogram reveals that September tends to be the weakest month for Apple's stock, typically followed by a strong performance in October. Historical data shows that Apple's stock price ended September lower 67% of the time. However, the stock experienced a rise of over 70% of the time in October. If the stock price has dipped in September, the odds of a robust October performance increase to 75%.A more detailed analysis reveals that from October 3rd through December 7th, Apple's share price has seen an increase nearly 70% of the time, with an average gain exceeding 13%.The monthly dynamic cycle for Apple's shares tends to bottom out in October. In the past year, two buy signals have been generated, both of which have resulted in successful investments.However, it's worth noting that the current market turbulence may not have fully played out.

By Byron Kaye and Himanshi AkhandSYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's biggest airline Qantas Airways said on Monday it will spend more than previously planned to improve ""customer pain points"" but warned spiralling fuel costs may force it to raise fares from already-elevated levels.The update sent its shares down as much as 2.5% to a one-year low as investors questioned the airline's ability to grow profit given persistently high costs.The company, under a new CEO, is trying to navigate a path between reassuring customers it is taking seriously complaints of widespread service problems while telling investors it can contain a surge in costs linked to tight oil supply.The airline that sells three in five Australian domestic fares has seen its reputation tumble in its home market as its handling of the post-COVID travel revival brought a wave of flight cancellations and reports of lost luggage. Adding to its woes, last month the antitrust regulator sued Qantas accusing it of selling fares on thousands of already-cancelled flights in 2022. Qantas also lost a union lawsuit when the High Court found its 2020 sacking of thousands of groundstaff was illegal.The so-called ""flying kangaroo"" said it would now spend A$80 million ($52 million) on ""customer improvements"" on top of the A$150 million previously flagged.""This additional investment is aimed at addressing a number of customer 'pain points' through improvements such as better contact centre resourcing and training ... more generous recovery support when operational issues arise, a review of longstanding policies for fairness and improvements to the quality of inflight catering,"" it said in the trading update.At the same time, it said its forecast half-year fuel bill would jump by A$200 million ($129 million) to A$2.8 billion if the 30% jump in fuel prices it had faced since May persisted.""The group will continue to absorb these higher costs, but will monitor fuel prices in the weeks ahead and, if current levels are sustained, will look to adjust its settings,"" Qantas said.""Any changes would look to balance the recovery of higher costs with the importance of affordable travel in an environment where fares are already elevated.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Owen Birrell said the company would likely absorb the higher fuel costs ""until its target margins come under pressure and then would seek to claw back those costs through capacity cuts and higher fares.""We don't believe a material earnings shift is feasible from here given rising competition, growing consumer/business cost pressures and incoming re-investment in the product/platform,"" he said in a client note.($1 = 1.5559 Australian dollars)

40,Inside Vietnam's plans to dent China's rare earths dominance By Reuters,"Published Sep 24, 2023 09:05PM ETUpdated Sep 24, 2023 09:31PM ET","Position added successfully to:

By Francesco Guarascio and Khanh VuHANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam plans to restart its biggest rare-earths mine next year with a Western-backed project that could rival the world's largest, according to two companies involved, as part of a broader push to dent China's dominance in a sector that helps power advanced technologies.The move would be a step toward the Southeast Asian country's aim of building up a rare-earths supply chain, including developing its capacity to refine ores into metals used in magnets for electric vehicles, smartphones and wind turbines.As an initial step, Vietnam's government intends to launch tenders for multiple blocks of its Dong Pao mine before the year's end, said Tessa Kutscher, an executive at Australia's Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Minerals Ltd, which plans to bid for at least one concession. She cited unpublished information from Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, which did not respond to requests for comment.The auction's timing could change but the government plans to restart the mine next year, said Luu Anh Tuan, chairman of Vietnam Rare Earth JSC (VTRE), the country's main refiner and Blackstone's partner in the project.The proposed restart of Dong Pao - whose timeline, scale and degree of foreign financial support have not been reported previously - comes as many nations fret about their vulnerability to supply disruptions due to China's stranglehold on strategic minerals and its disputes with the U.S. and its allies. Beijing this year imposed export curbs on minor metals used in semiconductors, which an influential Chinese policy adviser warned was ""just a start"".Vietnam has the second-largest rare-earth deposits, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. But they have remained largely untapped, with investment discouraged by low prices that are effectively set by China because of its near-monopoly on the global market. Visiting Hanoi this month to upgrade bilateral relations, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an agreement to boost Vietnam's ability to lure investors for its rare-earth reserves.In interviews with Reuters, 12 industry executives, investors, analysts and foreign officials described plans for Vietnam, including investments they said showed how talk of derisking supply chains to reduce reliance on China is translating into action. Some acknowledged the difficulties of forging a rare-earths hub but said the gambit could make Vietnam a viable player while assuaging strategic worries, even if China remained dominant.Kutscher said Blackstone's investment in the project would be worth around $100 million if it wins. She added that the company was talking to potential clients, including electric car makers VinFast (NASDAQ:VFS) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), about possible contracts with set prices that would shield suppliers from fluctuations and guarantee buyers a secure supply chain.Sealing such deals would address a hurdle faced by developers in Vietnam. In recent years, Japanese investors  Toyota  (NYSE:TM) Tsusho and Sojitz abandoned projects at Dong Pao after China ramped up supply, pummelling prices. The Japanese firms did not respond to requests for comment.Yet despite the focus on derisking, it is unclear whether clients would be ready to pay a premium for Vietnam, said Dylan Kelly, of investment firm Terra Capital, noting the market in general was opaque.Asked about VinFast's potential involvement, a spokesperson for parent company Vingroup said the group's entity in charge of raw-material procurement, VinES, had no current plans with Blackstone involving rare earths. He did not address subsequent questions about VinFast specifically.Rivian did not reply to a request for comment.RIVALLING MOUNTAIN PASSEffective exploitation of Dong Pao - which has sat dormant for at least seven years, according to an official at state-controlled miner Lavreco, which owns a concession - would propel Vietnam into the top league of rare-earths producers.But refining rare earths is complex, and China controls many processing technologies. Dong Pao's estimated deposits also need to be reassessed with modern methods, according to Blackstone.Still, rare earths at Dong Pao are relatively easy to access and are mostly concentrated in bastnaesite ores, according to the Hanoi University of Mining and Geology. These are typically rich in cerium, used in flat screens, and lanthanides, such as praseodymium and neodymium, which go into magnets.Tuan said VTRE hoped to win a concession that would allow it to extract about 10,000 metric tons of rare-earth oxide (REO) equivalent a year, roughly one-third of the mine's expected annual output. Production could start around the end of 2024, he said.That would put Dong Pao's output slightly below that of California's Mountain Pass, one of the world's largest mines, which produced 43,000 metric tons of REO equivalent in 2022, according to the USGS.Vietnam also plans to develop additional mines. In July, Hanoi set a target to produce up to 60,000 tons of REO equivalent a year by 2030. China set a domestic quota of 210,000 tons last year.Those goals would see Vietnam producing 5% to 15% of China's projected output by the decade's end, said David Merriman, a research analyst at consultancy Project Blue, who expects China to increase production over that period. Vietnam's targets were ""ambitious, though they are not entirely out of the question"", he said.U.S. ENCOURAGEMENT The U.S. agreed during Biden's visit to help Vietnam better map its rare-earths resources and ""attract quality investment"", according to a White House fact sheet, a move that could encourage U.S. investors to bid for Vietnam's new concessions.Reuters could not determine whether concrete plans involving U.S. investors exist at this stage. Officials at the U.S. embassy in Hanoi, the White House and Department of Commerce did not reply to requests for comment. But recent U.S. attempts to gain a foothold in the Vietnamese industry did not succeed, said John Rockhold, a consultant to the rare-earths sector and president of the Hanoi chapter of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, adding that one such plan involving VTRE collapsed this year. That plan would have involved the shipment to the U.S. of rare earths refined by VTRE and possible future investment in Vietnam of $200 million, according to a non-public report for unspecified U.S. investors seen by Reuters. VTRE confirmed the shipment deal had foundered.Instead, VTRE in April announced a deal to supply 100 metric tons of rare-earth oxides this year to Australian Strategic Materials. ASM declined to comment on Dong Pao's exploitation.Blackstone, which is a partner in that deal, operates a nickel mine in Vietnam and has determined that its processing facility in the country could handle ore from Dong Pao, according to a company statement.FROM ORE TO MAGNETUltimately, VTRE plans to play a role in the whole rare-earth industry from ore extraction to the final products, said Tuan, who with his wife owns most VTRE shares, according to a list of shareholders he showed to Reuters. Blackstone said the ownership information accorded with its assessment following due diligence.This is not an easy feat. The U.S. currently exports its rare-earth ores to China for processing as it lacks its own facilities.An existing VTRE factory in northern Vietnam specialises in separating rare-earth oxides from the extracted ore. The plant has capacity to process 5,000 tons of REO a year but the company plans to treble that to accommodate input from Dong Pao, Tuan said.Once separated, oxides are turned into metals for use in magnets and other industrial applications. The metallization process is controlled by China, which produces 90% of rare-earth metals, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.But VTRE is running a pilot project to build a metallization factory with South Korea's Setopia, said Setopia, which has no previous experience in the sector.The initial combined investment would be around $4 million, mostly from Setopia, a Setopia official told Reuters, with a plant possibly ready next year.In the downstream industry, South Korean and Chinese magnet firms are set to open factories in Vietnam, Reuters reported in August.Dudley Kingsnorth, a professor at the Western Australian School of Mines at Curtin University, said Vietnam had some way to go, including in improving environmental practices, to realise its rare-earth goals.Still, he said, Vietnam ""has the resources, the mining and processing expertise to provide alternatives to China"".

Initially, The Wall Street Journal reported that the EV giant was in preliminary discussions with Arab government about establishing a manufacturing facility in the country. Citing unnamed sources, the report highlighted potential challenges stemming from the complex relationship between Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, and Saudi officials, as well as Saudi Arabia's existing collaboration with electric vehicle competitor Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID).If a deal were to materialize, it could have a significant impact on Tesla's ambitious goal of selling 20 million vehicles annually by 2030, as Elon Musk has previously suggested. This objective might require around twelve additional manufacturing facilities worldwide. Currently, Tesla manufactures vehicles in the United States, China, and Germany, with plans to expand operations into Mexico.However, the story took an unexpected turn when Elon Musk himself took to his social media platform ""X"" to deny The Wall Street Journal's report. Musk dismissed the article as ""another utterly false article from the WSJ.""The Wall Street Journal had based its report on information from unnamed sources who acknowledged that the talks between Tesla and Saudi Arabia were still in their early stages and could potentially fall apart.Shares of TSLA reached a weekly high of $272.13 on Wednesday before ending the week down 8%.As always, InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Start your 7-day trial to get on board!Vietnamese automaker VinFast Auto (NASDAQ:VFS) is making significant strides. In its first quarterly report since going public in August, Vinfast announced a remarkable 131.2% increase in revenue. The company reported Q2 revenue of 7.95 trillion Vietnamese dong ($327 million) for the period ending on June 30th. This impressive growth can be attributed to a substantial surge in deliveries, with 9,535 vehicles delivered during the second quarter, marking a more than fivefold increase compared to the first quarter. In the first half of the year, Vinfast reported a total of 11,315 deliveries, showcasing its expanding presence in the electric vehicle market.Despite a history of losses, Vinfast achieved a valuation of approximately $85 billion upon its Wall Street debut, surpassing the valuations of U.S. automakers Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM). This valuation surge was fueled by increased delivery volume and reductions in research and development expenses, leading to a reduction in net loss from 13.65 trillion Vietnamese dong to 12.54 trillion Vietnamese dong.Additionally, Vinfast CEO Thuy Le revealed plans to send the first batch of electric vehicles to Europe later this year, following regulatory approval. Approximately 3,000 VF8 crossover vehicles will be shipped to France, Germany, and the Netherlands during the fourth quarter from VinFast's manufacturing facility in northern Vietnam.This marks a significant expansion, surpassing their previous target of delivering 700 vehicles by July of the previous year. The move into the European market is strategically timed, given the European Union's investigation into Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, potentially creating an opening for Vinfast.Shares of VFS ended the week down 3% to $15.63/sh.EVs made significant strides in the European market in August, with data released by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) revealing that slightly over 20% of all new cars purchased in the European Union were fully electric.

42,Ford offers Unifor wage increases up to 25% By Reuters,"Published Sep 23, 2023 09:26AM ETUpdated Sep 23, 2023 11:25AM ET","Position added successfully to: 
(Reuters) -Ford Motor has offered Canadian union Unifor wage increases of up to 25% in its tentative agreement, the union said on Saturday.The agreement provides a 10% wage increase for the first year followed by increases of 2% and 3% through the second and third year and a $10,000 productivity and quality bonus to all employees on the active roll of the company, Unifor said. The proposals also include an increase in the monthly basic benefit and special allowance in all class codes across defined benefit and hybrid pension plans and investments to help transition from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle production to electric vehicle (EV) assembly facilities. Unifor, which represents about 5,600 Canadian auto workers, on Friday said that its Ford (NYSE:F) leadership group has voted unanimously to support the tentative agreement.Ford is also in the midst of contract negotiations in the U.S. with a strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union at its at the automaker's Wayne, Michigan assembly plant.The UAW began strikes on Friday against 38 parts distribution centers across the United States at GM and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), extending its unprecedented, simultaneous strikes that began with one assembly plant each of the Detroit Three. The additional facilities added about 5,600 workers to the 12,700 already on strike.The UAW said on Friday that Ford had improved its contract offer, including boosting profit sharing and agreeing to let workers strike over plant closures but said the union still has ""serious issues"" with Ford and its workers would remain on strike at the automaker's Wayne, Michigan assembly plant. Unlike UAW, Unifor chose one of the Detroit Three as a ""target"" to negotiate with first - in this case, Ford - in a pattern bargaining tactic used to set the tone for subsequent deals with other companies.UAW President Shawn Fain said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:META) live event that by targeting distribution centers the strike becomes a nationwide event. He said he expected talks to continue through the weekend.The standoff is fueling worries about prolonged industrial action that could disrupt production and dent U.S. economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers. U.S. President Joe Biden said in a social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he would come to Michigan on Tuesday ""to join the picket line and stand in solidarity with the men and women of UAW,"" while former President Donald Trump, who is seeking a new term, will be in Michigan on Wednesday to address auto workers, his campaign said.

By Lisa Richwine and Dawn ChmielewskiLOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Striking Hollywood writers and top studio executives met for a third straight day on Friday, ending with a decision to continue talks on Saturday as they try to end a work stoppage that has shut down film and TV production for months. While workers across the entertainment industry waited for word of the outcome, no agreement was announced as the strike reached its 144th day.The WGA said in a statement early on Saturday that the two sides would meet again on Saturday.Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) Co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) CEO David Zaslav and Donna Langley, chairman of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s NBCUniversal Studio Group, took part in the talks with the Writers Guild of America (WGA) for a third day. Representatives for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios, had no comment.While the two sides met, union members turned out in large numbers in response to an appeal from WGA negotiators on Thursday to flood picket lines outside the studios. In the crowd outside Netflix on Friday was ""Mad Men"" creator and writer Matthew Weiner, who like others voiced optimism that the recent talks signaled progress was being made.""I'm hopeful,"" Weiner said of the possibility that the strike could be coming to an end. ""I would like to go back to work and I would like to start mending these relationships."" Roughly 11,500 WGA members walked off the job in May, demanding higher pay and residuals in the streaming TV era plus limits around the use of artificial intelligence.Producer and WGA member Al Septien, also picketing outside Netflix on Friday, said he wanted to get back to work, but only under the right terms.""We've been out here a long time. We don't want to fold for a less-than-fair and good contract for the writers,” he said.The SAG-AFTRA actors union also is on strike after walking off the job in July.

(Reuters) - Fox Corp's former chairman Rupert Murdoch's total compensation for 2023 climbed more than 24% to $22.9 million, a regulatory filing showed on Friday. The media mogul stepped down from his role on Thursday after a career spanning more than seven decades and handed the reins to his son, Lachlan Murdoch, who will become the sole chairman of News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) and continue as chair and CEO of Fox. Rupert Murdoch will be chairman emeritus of both companies.At Fox, his 2023 compensation includes an annual base salary of $5 million and about $7.6 million in stock awards and options. It also includes $4.4 million in incentive pay, the filing showed.Lachlan's compensation at Fox stands at $21.8 million for 2023, little changed from last year's $21.7 million. He is set to take over the Murdoch media empire at a time when the industry faces challenges ranging from dwindling traditional television viewership to copyright theft allegations. Separately on Friday, Fox nominated former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott AC and Magic Leap CEO Peggy Johnson to the company's board.

By David Shepardson and Joseph WhiteDETROIT (Reuters) -The United Auto Workers expanded its strikes against Detroit automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), but kept its Ford (NYSE:F) walkout limited to a single plant due to progress made in talks, the union said on Friday. The auto workers' union began strikes at noon EDT (1600 GMT) on Friday against 38 parts distribution centers across the United States at GM and Stellantis, extending its unprecedented, simultaneous strikes that began with one assembly plant each of the Detroit Three. The additional facilities added about 5,600 workers to the 12,700 already on strike.UAW President Shawn Fain said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:META) live event that by targeting distribution centers the strike becomes a nationwide event. He said he expected talks to continue through the weekend.Hours after Fain invited President Joe Biden to visit a picket line, Biden said in a social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he would come to Michigan on Tuesday ""to join the picket line and stand in solidarity with the men and women of UAW."" He added: ""It’s time for a win-win agreement that keeps American auto manufacturing thriving with well-paid UAW jobs."" The president has been vocal in his support for the union's demands for better pay and benefits. Former President Donald Trump, who is seeking a new term, will be in Michigan on Wednesday to address auto workers, his campaign said.Fain said the decision on the expanded strike would impact consumers trying to obtain repair parts. The distribution centers are warehouses that ship parts to dealers and other retailers for use in repairs. ""We will be everywhere from California to Massachusetts, from Oregon to Florida."" At a GM parts distribution center outside Philadelphia, picketing workers said the strike will result in cars sitting longer for repairs but that is the only way to get the higher wages they seek.""If you look at the past few years, car prices went up 30% but our wages went up 6%. We are not the problem,"" said Thomas Morris, 60, who has worked at the center in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, for the past four decades. ""I understand it’s going to cost some pain for people, but we are just looking for fairness.""Fain said they have more work to do at Ford, but ""we do want to recognize that Ford is showing they're serious about reaching a deal."" He added: ""Stellantis and GM in particular are going to need some serious pushing."" He also threatened more action at Stellantis' critical parts plants in his hometown of Kokomo, Indiana. Stellantis has four factories in Kokomo that make engines and transmissions used widely across the automaker's product line. Stellantis has said it wants to be able to consolidate and close some of its parts distribution centers.Fain said Ford had improved its contract offer, including boosting profit sharing and agreeing to let workers strike over plant closures but said the union still has ""serious issues"" with Ford. GM said in a statement that UAW leaders are ""manipulating the bargaining process for their own personal agendas"" and called the strike escalation ""unnecessary."" Stellantis said on Thursday it made a ""very competitive offer"" and said the union's leadership seems ""more concerned about pursuing their own political agendas.""GM, which said it had contingency plans it did not specify to protect its business and customers, said it has made five separate offers to the union.Ford said it is continuing to negotiate, adding that ""we have more work ahead of us before we can reach an agreement."" Nearly 13,000 UAW workers walked out at plants in Missouri, Michigan and Ohio on Sept 15. Those plants produce the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, alongside other popular models. But Ford and Canadian union Unifor reached a last-minute deal to avoid a walkout on Tuesday. Unifor's Ford leadership unanimously endorsed the tentative agreement late on Friday. Ratification meetings for members were set for Saturday, Unifor said.Wedbush Analyst Daniel Ives said this latest move by the UAW marks a divergence in the talks with the automakers.""The current deal is a torpedo to the business models of the Detroit 3,"" he said. ""To take a deal just to avoid a strike and get it done is great for the next 24 hours but a nightmare for the next 30 years.""Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said Ford's family-controlled structure gives it a different focus than the other two. ""GM and Stellantis are looking at stockholder value and Ford is looking a lot more long-term that they have to make friends with labor."" The standoff is fueling worries about prolonged industrial action that could disrupt production and dent U.S. economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers.The automakers have proposed 20% raises over 4-1/2 years, while the UAW is seeking 40%.The union also wants to eliminate wage gaps separating newer and older employees, as well as workers in certain component operations and those in assembly plants. Fain said on Friday that the union had negotiated the elimination of lower wage tiers in some components facilities at Ford and GM. But Stellantis has not agreed to raise wages at its MOPAR component operations, Fain said.

By Zeba Siddiqui and Raphael SatterSAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About a year ago, the U.S. security firm Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) began to hear from a flurry of companies that had been hacked in ways that weren't the norm for cybercriminals. Native English-speaking hackers would call up a target company’s information technology helpdesk posing as an employee, and seek login details by pretending to have lost theirs. They had all the employee information needed to sound convincing. And once they got access, they’d quickly find their way into the company's most sensitive repositories to steal that data for extortion.Ransomware attacks are not new, but this group was extraordinarily skilled at social engineering and bypassing multi-factor authentication, said Wendi Whitmore, senior vice president for the security firm Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team, which has responded to several intrusions tied to the group.""They are much more sophisticated than many cybercriminal actors. They appear to be disciplined and organized in their attacks,"" she said. ""And that's something we typically see more frequently with nation-state actors, versus cyber criminals.""Known in the security industry variously as Scattered Spider, Muddled Libra, and UNC3944, these hackers were thrust into the limelight earlier this month for breaching the systems of two of the world's largest gambling companies - MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) and Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment Ltd.Behind the scenes, it has hit many more companies, according to analysts tracking the intrusions - and cybersecurity specialists expect the attacks to continue. The FBI is investigating the MGM and Caesars breaches, and the companies did not comment on who may be behind them.From Canada to Japan, the security firm CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has tracked 52 attacks globally by the group since March 2022, most of them in the United States, said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of threat intelligence at the company. Google-owned intelligence firm Mandiant, has logged more than 100 intrusions by it in the last two years. Nearly every industry, from telecommunications to finance, hospitality, and media, has been hit. Reuters was not able to determine how much money the hackers may have extorted.But it's not just the scale or the breadth of attacks that make this group stand out. They're extremely good at what they do and ""ruthless"" in their interactions with victims, said Kevin Mandia, Mandiant's founder.The speed at which they breach and exfiltrate data from company systems can overwhelm security response teams, and they have left threatening notes for staff of victim organizations on their systems, and contacted them by text and email in the past, Mandiant found.In some cases - Mandia did not say which ones - hackers tied to Scattered Spider placed bogus emergency calls to summon heavily armed police units to the homes of executives of targeted companies. The technique, called SWATing, ""is something that’s utterly dreadful to live through as a victim,"" he said. ""I don’t even think these intrusions are about money. I think they’re about power, influence and notoriety. That makes it harder to respond to.""Reuters couldn't immediately reach the hacking group for comment. 17-22 YEAR OLDS There's little detail on Scattered Spider's location or identity. Based on the criminals’ chats with victims and clues gleaned from breach investigations, CrowdStrike's Meyers said they are largely 17-22 years-olds. Mandiant estimates they’re mainly from Western countries, but it's unclear how many people are involved. Before calling helpdesks, the hackers acquire employee information including passwords by social engineering, especially 'SIM swapping' - a technique where they trick a telecom company's customer service representative to reassign a specific phone number from one device to another, analysts say.They also appear to make the effort to study how large organizations work, including their vendors and contractors, to find individuals with privileged access they can target, according to analysts. That’s something David Bradbury, chief security officer of the identity management firm Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), saw first-hand last month, when he discovered multiple Okta customers – including MGM – breached by Scattered Spider. Okta provides identity services such as multi-factor authentication used to help users securely access online applications and websites.""The threat actors have clearly taken our courses that we provide online, they've clearly studied our product and how it works,"" Bradbury said. ""This is stuff we haven't seen before."" A larger group named ALPHV said last week it was behind the MGM hack, and analysts believe it provided the software and attack tools for the operation to be carried out by Scattered Spider. Such collaborations are typical for cybercriminals, said Okta's Bradbury. ALPHV, which according to Mandiant is a ""ransomware-as-a-service"", would provide services such as a helpdesk, webpage and branding, and in turn get a cut of whatever Scattered Spider would make from the hack. While many ransomware attacks go unpublicised, the MGM hack was a vivid example of the real-world impact of such incidents. It caused chaos in Las Vegas, as gaming machines stalled and hotel systems were disrupted. Ransomware gangs often function like large organizations, and continue to evolve their methods to adapt to the latest security measures organizations use. ""In some ways this is just like the age-old game of cat and mouse,"" said Whitmore, who compared Scattered Spider to Lapsus$, another group behind previous hacks into Okta and the technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The British police last year arrested seven people between the ages of 16 and 21 following those hacks.

By Doyinsola Oladipo and Abhirup Roy(Reuters) - U.S. auto workers expanded their strike on Friday with a clear target for distress: dealers who sell and service GM and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) vehicles. Selling and installing parts is one of the most profitable parts of the auto business, but it is also one of the most vulnerable, because the industry relies on just-in-time shipments. The strategy of choking parts delivery increases problems for some dealers who say it already had been difficult to source some components.""It's going to become near impossible to get a lot of these parts,"" said Richard Fasulo, a diagnostic technician from Wappinger, New York, who works for a Cadillac franchise dealer and used car dealers. The broader strike, which targets 38 parts distribution centers owned by GM and Stellantis, ""is going to have these shops telling their customers 'We don't know when we can fix your vehicle. It might be indefinitely.'""Selling repair parts and service returns is the key to many dealers' profits, and returns 40% or better gross profit margins for big auto retail chains such as AutoNation (NYSE:AN) and Lithia.""If your car doesn't work, you're just stuck. It's just mean, don't you think?"" said Howard Drake, a GM dealership owner based in California, describing the difficult situation for customers needing repairs. ""I thought the punishment would be in the form of adverse selection for customers with limited choice. I didn't think it would be my lot stacked up with cars that I can't fix because they won't man a parts distribution center,"" he said. National Association of Auto Dealers President and CEO Mike Stanton said: ""Dealers don't want to see anything to limit our potential to serve customers, so we certainly hope automakers and the UAW can reach an agreement quickly and amicably.""The UAW had been expected to expand their strike by shutting down plants that made the highest-profit vehicles, such as pickup trucks. But automakers have built up vehicle inventory and for many dealers problems with repairs will start soon.""It's definitely going to impact customers,"" said Thomas Morris, 60, who went on strike on Friday at a General Motors (NYSE:GM) parts distribution center in the suburbs of Philadelphia.The center serves GM dealerships from Pennsylvania to Maine, moving some 30,000 parts for auto repairs each day, workers said.GM said in a statement the company has ""contingency plans for various scenarios"" while Stellantis said it was awaiting a response from UAW to their ""competitive offer"" on Thursday and looking forward to a ""productive engagement"".Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the UAW had made a smart move.""I think it is a great strategy going after the distribution centers,"" he added.

Central banks in the United States and the Eurozone are expected to find some respite this week as key indicators point towards a deceleration in consumer-price growth, as reported on Sunday. The Federal Reserve's favored inflation measure, which excludes food and energy costs, is projected to have fallen below 4% in August for the first time in nearly two years. Simultaneously, the Eurozone's annual core price growth measure is anticipated to have dipped to a year-low of 4.8% in September.This slowdown could offer solace to officials from both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB). Last week, both institutions hinted that their monetary tightening phase might be concluding or at least temporarily paused, directing their attention towards maintaining high interest rates to effectively combat inflation.However, vigilance remains crucial. The potential for crude oil prices reaching $100 per barrel could trigger further price growth. Recent surges in energy costs are already being felt. The comprehensive personal consumption expenditures price index favored by the Fed is anticipated to record one of this year's highest monthly increases when Friday's report is released.Despite these hikes, headline inflation in the Eurozone, also due for release on Friday, is projected to have considerably weakened to a two-year low of 4.5%. In addition to these developments, appearances by heads of the Fed and ECB, along with interest rate decisions from Hungary and Mexico, will keep market participants engaged this week. In the U.S., the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report may be the last set of government figures policymakers see for some time due to an impending government shutdown beginning October 1. The previous shutdown in 2013 resulted in delays for key reports such as employment data.Other significant data releases scheduled this week include new-home sales, consumer sentiment and durable goods orders. Furthermore, the Census Bureau will release its third estimate of second-quarter growth along with benchmark revisions. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to host a town hall with educators, while Fed officials Neel Kashkari, Austan Goolsbee, Thomas Barkin and John Williams are scheduled to speak at separate events.Meanwhile, in Canada, July's gross domestic product data will be released following preliminary data that suggested a stagnant economy for the month. This aligns with the central bank's decision to maintain interest rates at 5%.

But automakers have built up vehicle inventory and for many dealers problems with repairs will start soon.""It's definitely going to impact customers,"" said Thomas Morris, 60, who went on strike on Friday at a General Motors (NYSE:GM) parts distribution center in the suburbs of Philadelphia.The center serves GM dealerships from Pennsylvania to Maine, moving some 30,000 parts for auto repairs each day, workers said.GM said in a statement the company has ""contingency plans for various scenarios"" while Stellantis said it was awaiting a response from UAW to their ""competitive offer"" on Thursday and looking forward to a ""productive engagement"".Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the UAW had made a smart move.""I think it is a great strategy going after the distribution centers,"" he added. Services are big business, he said. ""That's how they make a lot of their money.""Brad Sowers, the CEO of Jim Butler Auto Group which owns the largest Chevrolet dealership in St.Louis, Missouri, said if a deal is not inked in 60 days he'll be upset, even though he had the foresight to load up on parts in anticipation of the strike.""I just want them to get together and get it done,"" he said.

(Reuters) -The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on Friday said it sued  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) for disability discrimination, alleging the delivery firm refused to hire deaf or hearing-impaired individuals as drivers.The agency said the Department of Transportation (DOT) has authorized the practice of employing those individuals to drive vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds through a program that exempts them from a hearing test and instead uses alternative criteria to ensure an equivalent level of driver safety. Atlanta-based UPS said it is modifying driver training for those who are deaf and hard of hearing and would start accepting exemptions to the DOT commercial driver hearing standard for operators of its ubiquitous brown delivery trucks in January 2024. UPS said training is necessary because ""current regulations do not consider best practices for driving larger commercial vehicles that make frequent stops in residential neighborhoods, or other significant factors UPS considers as it works to help keep its drivers and communities safe."" EEOC said it sued the world's largest parcel delivery firm under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) after failing to reach a pre-litigation settlement.""Just because someone is deaf does not mean they cannot drive safely,"" said Gregory Gochanour, EEOC's regional attorney in Chicago. The case, EEOC v. UPS, Civil Action No. 1:23-cv-14021, was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

By Lisa Richwine and Dawn ChmielewskiLOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Striking Hollywood writers and top studio executives met for a third straight day on Friday, ending with a decision to continue talks on Saturday as they try to end a work stoppage that has shut down film and TV production for months. While workers across the entertainment industry waited for word of the outcome, no agreement was announced as the strike reached its 144th day.The WGA said in a statement early on Saturday that the two sides would meet again on Saturday.Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) Co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) CEO David Zaslav and Donna Langley, chairman of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s NBCUniversal Studio Group, took part in the talks with the Writers Guild of America (WGA) for a third day. Representatives for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios, had no comment.While the two sides met, union members turned out in large numbers in response to an appeal from WGA negotiators on Thursday to flood picket lines outside the studios. In the crowd outside Netflix on Friday was ""Mad Men"" creator and writer Matthew Weiner, who like others voiced optimism that the recent talks signaled progress was being made.""I'm hopeful,"" Weiner said of the possibility that the strike could be coming to an end. ""I would like to go back to work and I would like to start mending these relationships."" Roughly 11,500 WGA members walked off the job in May, demanding higher pay and residuals in the streaming TV era plus limits around the use of artificial intelligence.Producer and WGA member Al Septien, also picketing outside Netflix on Friday, said he wanted to get back to work, but only under the right terms.""We've been out here a long time. We don't want to fold for a less-than-fair and good contract for the writers,” he said.The SAG-AFTRA actors union also is on strike after walking off the job in July.

Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks retreated on Monday as markets digested the outlook for higher interest rates in developed markets, while Chinese shares led losses amid persistent concerns over a property market crisis.Most regional stocks were nursing steep losses from the prior week after the Federal Reserve warned U.S. could rise further, and are likely to remain higher for longer. The outlook dented most risk-driven assets, and is set to dampen regional markets in the coming months. Sentiment was also on edge before a string of key regional economic readings this week.Renewed concerns over China also weighed, especially after embattled real estate developer China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) said it will be unable to issue new debt due to an ongoing government investigation into its unit Hengda Real Estate Group. News of the investigation had fueled fears of a broader government crackdown on the property sector, which is grappling with a brewing debt crisis.The property developer’s shares tumbled nearly 25% in Hong Kong trade, also sparking losses in other real estate stocks. Country Garden Services  (HK:6098) and Longfor Properties Co Ltd (HK:0960) slid about 3% each, dragging Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index down more than 1%. China’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes lost  between 0.3% and 0.5%. Chinese stocks have seen increased volatility this year, as markets weighed worsening economic conditions against bets that the government will roll out more stimulus measures to support growth.But sentiment has worsened in recent months, especially given Beijing’s conservative approach to more stimulus. Concerns over a meltdown in the property sector have also kept sentiment towards the country on edge.Focus this week is now on purchasing managers’ index data for September, which is expected to shed more light on business activity. While the manufacturing sector saw some improvement in August, service sector activity appeared to be deteriorating.Concerns over China spilled over into broader Asian markets. Australia’s ASX 200 fell 0.4%, with a reading on Australian consumer price index (CPI) inflation due this week.South Korea’s KOSPI sank 0.6%, while futures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a positive open after the index plummeted from record highs last week.Japan’s Nikkei 225 and TOPIX were the key outliers for the day, rising 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively.Local stocks reversed most losses from Friday after the Bank of Japan said it had no plans to scale back its monetary stimulus policies in the near-term, heralding continued support for the Japanese economy and stocks.A dovish BOJ has been one of the key drivers of a Japanese stock rally this year, with the Nikkei and the TOPIX trading just shy of a 33-year peak.Focus this week is on Tokyo inflation data for September, due on Friday. The reading acts as a precursor for countrywide inflation.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/asian-stocks-dip-china-slides-on-property-market-jitters-3181294

(Reuters) -Ford Motor has offered Canadian union Unifor wage increases of up to 25% in its tentative agreement, the union said on Saturday.The agreement provides a 10% wage increase for the first year followed by increases of 2% and 3% through the second and third year and a $10,000 productivity and quality bonus to all employees on the active roll of the company, Unifor said. The proposals also include an increase in the monthly basic benefit and special allowance in all class codes across defined benefit and hybrid pension plans and investments to help transition from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle production to electric vehicle (EV) assembly facilities. Unifor, which represents about 5,600 Canadian auto workers, on Friday said that its Ford (NYSE:F) leadership group has voted unanimously to support the tentative agreement.Ford is also in the midst of contract negotiations in the U.S. with a strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union at its at the automaker's Wayne, Michigan assembly plant.The UAW began strikes on Friday against 38 parts distribution centers across the United States at GM and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), extending its unprecedented, simultaneous strikes that began with one assembly plant each of the Detroit Three. The additional facilities added about 5,600 workers to the 12,700 already on strike.The UAW said on Friday that Ford had improved its contract offer, including boosting profit sharing and agreeing to let workers strike over plant closures but said the union still has ""serious issues"" with Ford and its workers would remain on strike at the automaker's Wayne, Michigan assembly plant. Unlike UAW, Unifor chose one of the Detroit Three as a ""target"" to negotiate with first - in this case, Ford - in a pattern bargaining tactic used to set the tone for subsequent deals with other companies.UAW President Shawn Fain said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:META) live event that by targeting distribution centers the strike becomes a nationwide event. He said he expected talks to continue through the weekend.The standoff is fueling worries about prolonged industrial action that could disrupt production and dent U.S. economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers. U.S. President Joe Biden said in a social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he would come to Michigan on Tuesday ""to join the picket line and stand in solidarity with the men and women of UAW,"" while former President Donald Trump, who is seeking a new term, will be in Michigan on Wednesday to address auto workers, his campaign said.

(NYSE:BRDS), a leading provider of environmentally friendly electric transportation, has been served with a notice from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) regarding the suspension of trading and commencement of delisting proceedings for the company's Class A common stock. The action, set to take effect at the start of business on September 25, 2023, comes in response to Bird's failure to meet an NYSE listing requirement for a market cap exceeding $15 million over a consecutive 30-day period.Despite the impending suspension, Bird maintains that its current market cap does not accurately represent the intrinsic value of the business and has announced plans to appeal the NYSE's determination. If successful, trading of Bird's Class A common stock on the NYSE will resume. In the meantime, Bird's Class A common stock intends to trade on the OTC exchange operated by OTC Markets Group Inc., starting next week.Bird's interim CEO, Michael Washinushi, expressed disappointment at the change in NYSE listing status but reaffirmed the company's commitment to shareholders, employees, partners, and associated cities and institutions. He emphasized that Bird's fundamentals remain strong and that the recent acquisition of Spin has bolstered its prospects.Earlier this year, Bird initiated a multi-step plan aimed at enhancing financial and operational performance. The plan involved leadership and operational restructuring as well as various cost-saving initiatives. John Bitove, Chair of Bird's Board of Directors, stated these steps were crucial in facilitating Bird's strategic acquisition of Spin. He believes this move is pivotal in making the company cash flow positive and generating more value for its stockholders in the long term.

Historical patterns, including election year cycles and ten-year cycles, suggest that the final quarter of the year could see a robust performance.Notably, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has demonstrated a highly seasonal pattern during the fall season. A monthly expected return histogram reveals that September tends to be the weakest month for Apple's stock, typically followed by a strong performance in October. Historical data shows that Apple's stock price ended September lower 67% of the time. However, the stock experienced a rise of over 70% of the time in October. If the stock price has dipped in September, the odds of a robust October performance increase to 75%.A more detailed analysis reveals that from October 3rd through December 7th, Apple's share price has seen an increase nearly 70% of the time, with an average gain exceeding 13%.The monthly dynamic cycle for Apple's shares tends to bottom out in October.

72,UK competition authority provisionally approves Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard By Investing.com,"Published Sep 24, 2023 09:39PM ET","The United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provided provisional approval on Monday for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s restructured acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI). The announcement was well-received by the UK's merger and acquisition sector, following previous approvals from the U.S. and E.U. The $68.7 billion deal, with Microsoft's offer standing at $95 per share, led to a roughly 2% increase in Activision Blizzard's stock, bringing it closer to the acquisition offer.The approval by the CMA is contingent on the transfer of cloud gaming rights to French video game publisher UbiSoft Entertainment. Over the next 15 years, Ubisoft will hold all of Activision Blizzard's cloud gaming rights, preventing Microsoft from exclusively releasing games on its Xbox Cloud. Notably, these rights include the Call of Duty brand, for which Ubisoft will compensate Microsoft with a one-time payment based on usage.Microsoft's shares remained virtually unchanged after the announcement. However, the tech giant has seen a year-to-date performance increase of 33%, surpassing both Activision Blizzard's 23% increase and broader indices.The proposed takeover could significantly boost Microsoft's growth prospects. Sales forecasts indicate a rise of 10% in fiscal 2024 to $233.80 billion for Microsoft, while Activision Blizzard sales are expected to jump 13% this year to $9.66 billion. This could potentially add nearly $10 billion in revenue to Microsoft, marking a 70% growth increase over the last five years from sales of $143.01 billion in fiscal 2020.This rate of growth would outpace Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s 47% sales growth over the same period. Apple currently holds the largest market cap on U.S. stock exchanges, just ahead of Microsoft. Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard has experienced a 49% increase in sales since 2019, surpassing Apple’s top-line expansion rate, suggesting a significant potential for compounded growth for Microsoft.In terms of earnings, Microsoft's bottom line is projected to rise 11% in FY24 and leap another 14% in FY25 to $12.42 per share. Microsoft's stock trades at 29.3X forward earnings, above the S&P 500's 20.2X, but mostly on par with the computer-software industry average. Activision Blizzard's annual earnings are expected to climb 23% this year and rise another 4% in FY24 at $4.37 per share.

73,"Even China's 1.4 billion population can't fill all its vacant homes, former official says By Reuters","Published Sep 23, 2023 07:38AM ETUpdated Sep 23, 2023 09:20AM ET","Position added successfully to: 
BEIJING (Reuters) - Even China's population of 1.4 billion would not be enough to fill all the empty apartments littered across the country, a former official said on Saturday, in a rare public critique of the country's crisis-hit property market. China's property sector, once the pillar of the economy, has slumped since 2021 when real estate giant China  Evergrande  (HK:3333) Group defaulted on its debt obligations following a clampdown on new borrowing. Big-name developers such as Country Garden Holdings continue to teeter close to default even to this day, keeping home-buyer sentiment depressed.As of the end of August, the combined floor area of unsold homes stood at 648 million square metres (7 billion square feet), the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show. That would be equal to 7.2 million homes, according to Reuters calculations, based on the average home size of 90 square metres.That does not count the numerous residential projects that have already been sold but not yet completed due to cash-flow problems, or the multiple homes purchased by speculators in the last market upturn in 2016 that remain vacant, which together make up the bulk of unused space, experts estimate.""How many vacant homes are there now? Each expert gives a very different number, with the most extreme believing the current number of vacant homes are enough for 3 billion people,"" said He Keng, 81, a former deputy head of the statistics bureau.""That estimate might be a bit much, but 1.4 billion people probably can't fill them,"" He said at a forum in the southern Chinese city Dongguan, according to a video released by the official media China News Service.His negative view of the economically significant sector at a public forum stands in sharp contrast to the official narrative that the Chinese economy is ""resilient"". ""All sorts of comments predicting the collapse of China's economy keep surfacing every now and then, but what has collapsed is such rhetoric, not China's economy,"" a spokesperson at the foreign ministry said at a recent news conference.

74,Tyson and Perdue face child labor investigations - New York Times By Reuters,"Published Sep 23, 2023 12:29PM ET","(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Labor has opened investigations into meat companies  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) and Perdue Farms to determine whether migrant children were used to clean slaughterhouses, the New York Times reported on Saturday.

The Labor Department and Tyson Foods did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.A Perdue spokesperson said the company had not been notified of the investigation but planned to cooperate fully with any government inquiry on the matter. ""We are conducting a comprehensive third-party audit of child labor prevention and protection procedures including a compliance audit of contractors,"" Purdue's spokesperson said.The Labor Department has also opened investigations into Fayette Industrial and QSI that run cleaning shifts for Perdue and Tyson respectively, the newspaper said. QSI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Fayette Industrial could not immediately be reached for comment. In April the Biden administration sent a letter to meat companies including Tyson and Perdue asking the companies to examine their supply chains for evidence of child labor.The letter was part of an effort by several agencies, led by the Labor Department, to curb the use of illegal child labor across sectors.

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap of the past week's biggest headlines in the electric vehicle space: Elon Musk claims WSJ report ‘utterly false’; VinFast posts impressive results; and EVs are taking over EU.Get news like this in real time by signing up for InvestingPro.Conflicting reports have emerged this week regarding Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) potential expansion plans in Saudi Arabia. Initially, The Wall Street Journal reported that the EV giant was in preliminary discussions with Arab government about establishing a manufacturing facility in the country. Citing unnamed sources, the report highlighted potential challenges stemming from the complex relationship between Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, and Saudi officials, as well as Saudi Arabia's existing collaboration with electric vehicle competitor Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID).If a deal were to materialize, it could have a significant impact on Tesla's ambitious goal of selling 20 million vehicles annually by 2030, as Elon Musk has previously suggested. This objective might require around twelve additional manufacturing facilities worldwide. Currently, Tesla manufactures vehicles in the United States, China, and Germany, with plans to expand operations into Mexico.However, the story took an unexpected turn when Elon Musk himself took to his social media platform ""X"" to deny The Wall Street Journal's report. Musk dismissed the article as ""another utterly false article from the WSJ.""The Wall Street Journal had based its report on information from unnamed sources who acknowledged that the talks between Tesla and Saudi Arabia were still in their early stages and could potentially fall apart.Shares of TSLA reached a weekly high of $272.13 on Wednesday before ending the week down 8%.As always, InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Start your 7-day trial to get on board!Vietnamese automaker VinFast Auto (NASDAQ:VFS) is making significant strides. In its first quarterly report since going public in August, Vinfast announced a remarkable 131.2% increase in revenue. The company reported Q2 revenue of 7.95 trillion Vietnamese dong ($327 million) for the period ending on June 30th. This impressive growth can be attributed to a substantial surge in deliveries, with 9,535 vehicles delivered during the second quarter, marking a more than fivefold increase compared to the first quarter. In the first half of the year, Vinfast reported a total of 11,315 deliveries, showcasing its expanding presence in the electric vehicle market.Despite a history of losses, Vinfast achieved a valuation of approximately $85 billion upon its Wall Street debut, surpassing the valuations of U.S. automakers Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM). This valuation surge was fueled by increased delivery volume and reductions in research and development expenses, leading to a reduction in net loss from 13.65 trillion Vietnamese dong to 12.54 trillion Vietnamese dong.Additionally, Vinfast CEO Thuy Le revealed plans to send the first batch of electric vehicles to Europe later this year, following regulatory approval. Approximately 3,000 VF8 crossover vehicles will be shipped to France, Germany, and the Netherlands during the fourth quarter from VinFast's manufacturing facility in northern Vietnam.This marks a significant expansion, surpassing their previous target of delivering 700 vehicles by July of the previous year. The move into the European market is strategically timed, given the European Union's investigation into Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, potentially creating an opening for Vinfast.Shares of VFS ended the week down 3% to $15.63/sh.EVs made significant strides in the European market in August, with data released by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) revealing that slightly over 20% of all new cars purchased in the European Union were fully electric.
