1,"Toyota to speed up EV production, aims for over 600,000 vehicles in 2025 - Nikkei ",2023-09-22 00:35:00-04:00,") -Toyota Motor will speed up production of electric vehicles of its  Toyota  (NYSE:TM) and luxury Lexus brands, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Friday.The Nikkei report said the Japanese automaker was likely to step up production of battery-powered vehicles over the coming years to reach annual output of more than 600,000 vehicles in 2025. Toyota declined to comment on the report.The company has previously said it targets sales of 1.5 million EVs annually by 2026 and 3.5 million, or about one-third of current global volume, by 2030.Toyota last year sold fewer than 25,000 EVs, including of its Lexus brand, worldwide.It sought to raise EV production to about 150,000 vehicles in 2023 and gradually increase it further to the 190,000-vehicle range next year, Nikkei said.

2,U.S. Bancorp's capital prospects improve despite challenging banking environment ,2023-09-22 03:04:00-04:00,"Position added successfully to: 
Position added successfully to: 
The U.S. banking sector has faced significant challenges in 2023, with U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), the fifth-largest bank in the U.S. by assets, under particular scrutiny following the failure of a few regional banks earlier this year. However, despite a turbulent environment and concerns over regulatory capital ratios, the bank is making strides in improving its financial position.Earlier this week, U.S. Bancorp was highlighted for its unusual operating income growth potential relative to peer banks amid the banking sector meltdown triggered by Silicon Valley Bank's failure. Despite the market's focus on survival and capital requirements, the bank's share price experienced an almost 30% decline, one of the most severe amongst its peers.In response to the Federal Reserve's new capital rules unveiled on July 27, U.S. Bancorp and other banks are required to hold more capital than before, reducing their earnings potential. Despite pushback from several bank CEOs and Congress, it remains unclear whether these rules will undergo significant revision.Specifically for U.S. Bancorp, management is currently working on building capital in anticipation of becoming a “Category II” bank. They aim to increase their Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio to 9.0% by year-end from around 8.5%. Measures taken include meaningful risked asset sales ($8.6B in Q2’23) and issuing 24M common shares to Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial (MUFJ) to settle some of its debt obligations to Union Bank’s former parent as part of their purchase agreement.These efforts appear to be paying off as U.S. Bancorp is now ahead of schedule and likely to end FY’24 with a CET1 ratio of 8.7% under Category II rules, meeting management’s target for 2024. This progress may allow the bank to avoid taking further earnings-compromising steps to reach its capital targets and potentially raise capital returns to shareholders sooner than expected.However, current operating conditions remain difficult. Despite the Federal Reserve's decision to hold steady on rates, deposit rates continue to climb. This has led to a modest decline in average deposits for U.S. Bancorp in the second quarter (down almost 3%), with non-interest-bearing deposits declining more than 12% and rising deposit costs pushing up the bank’s deposit beta.Meanwhile, loan growth is slowing across the industry, with the latest Fed data showing 2% year-over-year growth in lending among large banks. In response, management has already reduced guidance a few times this year and recently indicated net interest income towards the lower end of the range.Despite these challenges, U.S. Bancorp is focusing on opportunities to drive core earnings leverage over the next couple of years, centered on Union Bank. These include cross-selling to the bank's large consumer and small business customer base and post-merger cost savings. The bank's exposure to payments could also prove beneficial if the U.S. economy performs better than expected.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Global equities experienced their most significant outflows since December 2022, with a total of $16.9 billion leaving the market, according to Bank of America.This trend was led by U.S. stocks and is linked to rising concerns of a potential economic hard landing, according to the bank’s strategists. In contrast, bonds saw inflows of $2.5 billion, while $4.3 billion exited money markets, and gold lost $300 million.BofA continues to advocate for a ""sell the last hike"" approach and point to various indicators, such as yield curve steepening, rising unemployment rates, increased personal savings, higher high-yield defaults, and more credit card and auto loan delinquencies, as potential signs of a hard landing.“Sell the last rate hike""...strategy tends to work when monetary policy needs to work harder to slow economy in inflationary era (e.g. 1970s/1980s); 5-year Treasury at 5% we think buy, meantime stagflationary barbell in stocks (long energy, long staples), or contrarian trades via long “hard landing” plays e.g. REITs, retail (XRT), banks (BKX) vs “no landing” plays Mag7, SOX, XHB, XLI, XBD; and own gold as hedge against nightmare of higher yields and lower US dollar on loss of credibility of US policy makers,” the strategists explained.Despite these concerns, investors have allocated $1.0 trillion to cash year-to-date, with significant investments in Treasuries, investment-grade bonds, equities, and the technology sector, suggesting a cautious approach and willingness to wait for market developments.Bank of America’s analysis shows a strong correlation between U.S. job openings (labor demand) and stock market, which suggests that U.S. stocks are to move lower in the near term.U.S. equities lost $17.9 billion in a week to Wednesday. In contrast, emerging markets (EM) saw inflows of $1.4 billion, indicating some investor interest in these markets.Japan had its second consecutive week of outflows at $300 million, suggesting caution in the Japanese equity market. Europe continued to experience outflows for the 28th consecutive week, with $3.1 billion leaving the region's equities.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sell-the-last-rate-hike-strategy-is-in-action-stocks-could-fall-further--bofa-432SI-3180474,investing.com,2023-09-22,"['last', 'rate', 'hike', 'strategy', 'action', 'stock', 'could', 'fall', 'bofa', 'position', 'add', 'successfully', 'position', 'add', 'successfully', 'position', 'add', 'successfully', 'position', 'add', 'successfully', 'position', 'add', 'successfully', 'position', 'add', 'successfully', 'position', 'add', 'successfully', 'position', 'add', 'successfully', 'position', 'add', 'successfully', 'global', 'equity', 'experience', 'significant', 'outflow', 'since', 'december', 'total', 'billion', 'leave', 'market', 'accord', 'bank', 'trend', 'lead', 'stock', 'link', 'rise', 'concern', 'potential', 'economic', 'hard', 'land', 'accord', 'bank', 'strategist', 'in', 'contrast', 'bond', 'saw', 'inflows', 'billion', 'billion', 'exit', 'money', 'market', 'gold', 'lose', 'continue', 'advocate', 'sell', 'last', 'hike', 'approach', 'point', 'various', 'indicator', 'yield', 'curve', 'steepen', 'rise', 'unemployment', 'rate', 'increase', 'personal', 'saving', 'higher', 'default', 'credit', 'card', 'auto', 'loan', 'delinquencies', 'potential', 'sign', 'hard', 'sell', 'last', 'rate', 'hike', 'strategy', 'tend', 'work', 'monetary', 'policy', 'need', 'work', 'hard', 'slow', 'economy', 'inflationary', 'era', 'treasury', 'think', 'buy', 'meantime', 'stagflationary', 'barbell', 'stock', 'long', 'energy', 'long', 'staple', 'contrarian', 'trade', 'via', 'long', 'hard', 'landing', 'play', 'reit', 'retail', 'xrt', 'bank', 'bkx', 'vs', 'land', 'play', 'sox', 'xhb', 'xli', 'xbd', 'gold', 'hedge', 'nightmare', 'high', 'yield', 'low', 'u', 'dollar', 'loss', 'credibility', 'u', 'policy', 'maker', 'strategist', 'concern', 'investor', 'allocate', 'trillion', 'cash', 'significant', 'investment', 'treasury', 'bond', 'equity', 'technology', 'sector', 'suggest', 'cautious', 'approach', 'willingness', 'wait', 'market', 'america', 'analysis', 'show', 'strong', 'correlation', 'job', 'opening', 'labor', 'demand', 'stock', 'market', 'suggest', 'stock', 'move', 'low', 'near', 'equity', 'lose', 'billion', 'week', 'wednesday', 'in', 'contrast', 'emerge', 'market', 'em', 'saw', 'inflow', 'billion', 'indicate', 'investor', 'interest', 'second', 'consecutive', 'week', 'outflow', 'million', 'suggest', 'caution', 'japanese', 'equity', 'market', 'europe', 'continue', 'experience', 'outflow', 'consecutive', 'week', 'billion', 'leave', 'region', 'equity']"

Analysts from BMO Capital Markets have identified Eli Lilly & Co (NYSE:LLY). as the most likely pharmaceutical leader in the rapidly growing U.S. obesity drug market into the 2030s, according to a report published on Friday. Despite facing fierce competition from Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), the producer of Ozempic and Wegovy, Eli Lilly's diverse and effective product range is expected to provide a competitive edge.Eli Lilly's portfolio includes orforglipron, an oral medication, tirzepatide, an injectable drug, and retatrutide, a next-generation treatment. The company's strategic investments in manufacturing and planning for branded rollouts are anticipated to solidify its position in the market.The report also underscored the significant potential for growth in the obesity drug market both domestically and internationally. Analysts forecast that global sales for these drugs will reach an impressive $100 billion by 2035.Despite recent downturns in shares of leading companies in the obesity drug market, Eli Lilly's shares demonstrated resilience. On Friday morning trading, shares were up 0.5%, marking a 50% increase since the start of the year. Novo Nordisk has also experienced substantial growth with its shares up 1% in premarket trading and a total increase of 35% year-to-date.BMO Capital Markets analysts maintain an ""outperform"" rating on Eli Lilly's shares and set a target price at $633.

Piper Sandler technical analysts reflected on the S&P 500 performance and outlook for the rest of the year in the aftermath of the FOMC meeting.Following the decision not to raise interest rates at this week’s meeting, the U.S. stock market fell, while Treasury 10-year yields increased. The recent labor market data also supported the belief that the Federal Reserve is likely to maintain higher interest rates for a longer period than initially expected.Analysts expect the stock market will trade in a “drop/chop” mode in the following weeks before the S&P 500 delivers a rally into year-end. They see the S&P 500 rallying all the way to 4,825.“The weak September narrative continues playing out as expected, but long and intermediate-term uptrends remain intact.

6,"US government shutdown: What closes, what stays open? ",2023-09-21 10:23:00-04:00,") -Many U.S. government services would be disrupted and hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed without pay if Congress fails to provide funding for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Workers deemed ""essential"" would remain on the job, but without pay.Here is a guide to what happens during a government shutdown, and who would be affected:MILITARYThe two million U.S. military personnel would remain at their posts, but roughly half of the Pentagon's 800,000 civilian employees would be furloughed.Contracts awarded prior to the shutdown would continue, and the Pentagon could place new orders for supplies or services needed to protect national security. Other new contracts, including renewals or extensions, would not be awarded. Payments to defense contractors such as Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and RTX, formerly known as Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), could be delayed.The Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration would continue maintaining nuclear weapons.LAW ENFORCEMENTAgents at the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service and other federal law enforcement agencies would remain on the job. Prison staffers likewise would continue to work.Criminal prosecutions, including the two federal cases against former President Donald Trump, would continue. Most civil litigation would be postponed.Aid to local police departments and other grants could be delayed.Border Patrol and immigration enforcement agents would continue to work, as would customs officers. The Coast Guard would continue operations.Most of the Federal Trade Commission's consumer-protection workers would be furloughed, as would half of its antitrust employees.TRANSPORTATIONAirport security screeners and air-traffic control workers would be required to work, though absenteeism could be a problem. Some airports had to suspend operations during a shutdown in 2019 when traffic controllers called in sick.Training for new air traffic controllers would stop, which Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has warned could worsen a shortage of qualified workers.Some major infrastructure projects could face delays as environmental reviews and permitting would be disrupted.FOREIGN AFFAIRSU.S. embassies and consulates would remain open. Passport and visa processing would continue as long as there was sufficient fees to cover operations. Non-essential official travel, speeches and other events would be curtailed.Some foreign aid programs could run out of money as well.NATIONAL PARKS AND NATURAL RESOURCESIt's not clear how the United States' 63 national parks would be affected. They remained open during the 2018-2019 shutdown, through restrooms and information desks were closed and waste disposal was halted. They were closed during a 2013 shutdown.Wildfire fighting efforts would continue, though timber sales on national forest lands would be curtailed and fewer recreation permits would be issued.SCIENCEScientific research would be disrupted as agencies like the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration would furlough most of their workers.NASA would continue to support the International Space Station and track satellites, but 17,000 of its 18,300 employees would be furloughed.Weather forecasts and fisheries regulation would continue, as would patent and trademark reviews. Tests of new drugs and medical devices would continue.HEALTHThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would continue to monitor disease outbreaks, though other public health activities could suffer as more than half of the agency's workers would be furloughed.The National Institutes of Health would furlough most of its staff and delay new clinical trials for medical treatments.Health care services for veterans and Native Americans would continue.Most inspections of hazardous waste sites and drinking water and chemical facilities would stop. Cleanup of polluted Superfund sites would slow or stop.Food-safety inspections by the Food and Drug Administration could be delayed.FINANCIAL REGULATIONThe Securities and Exchange Commission would furlough roughly 90% of its 4,600 employees and suspend most activities, leaving only a skeleton staff to respond to emergencies.Likewise, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission would furlough almost all of its employees and cease oversight, enforcement and regulation.The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would continue as normal, as they are funded by industry fees rather than congressional appropriations.SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICAREThe Social Security Administration would continue to issue retirement and disability benefits, and payments would continue under the Medicare and Medicaid health programs.The Veterans Administration would continue to pay veterans' benefits.DISASTER RESPONSEMost employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency would remain on the job, but the agency would risk running out of funds for disaster relief and long-term recovery projects.AGRICULTURECrop subsidy programs would continue, as would meat, egg and fruit and vegetable inspections.EDUCATIONPell grants and student loans would continue to be paid, but could be disrupted as most Education Department employees would be furloughed.A protracted shutdown could ""severely curtail"" aid to schools, universities and other educational institutions, the department says. It also could delay funds that are due to be awarded later in the year.CHILD CAREAccording to the White House, 10,000 children from low-income families would lose access to the Head Start preschool program.SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORTThe Small Business Administration would not be able to issue any new loans, though loans for businesses hurt by natural disasters would continue.LABORWorkplace safety inspections would be limited and investigations into unfair pay practices would be suspended.The National Labor Relations Board's ability to mediate labor disputes would be curtailed as almost all of its 1,200 employees would be furloughed.WHITE HOUSEIn 2018-2019 shutdown, the White House furloughed 1,100 of 1,800 staff in the Executive Office of the President. Some offices, such as the National Security Council, continued at full strength, while others like the Office of Management and Budget were scaled back sharply.MAIL DELIVERYThe U.S. Postal Service would be unaffected as it does not depend on Congress for funding.

7,US finalizes rules to prevent China from benefiting from $52 billion in chips funding ,2023-09-22 01:02:00-04:00,") - The U.S. Commerce Department on Friday is issuing final rules to prevent semiconductor manufacturing subsidies from being used by China and other countries deemed to pose American national security concerns.The regulation is the final hurdle before the Biden administration can begin awarding $39 billion in subsidies for semiconductor production. The landmark ""Chips and Science"" law provides $52.7 billion for U.S. semiconductor production, research and workforce development.The regulation, first proposed in March, sets ""guardrails"" by limiting recipients of U.S. funding from investing in expanding semiconductor manufacturing in foreign countries of concern like China and Russia, and limits recipients of incentive funds from engaging in joint research or technology licensing efforts with foreign entities of concern.In October 2022, the department issued new export controls to cut China off from certain semiconductor chips made with U.S. equipment in its bid to slow Beijing's technological and military advances.""We have to be absolutely vigilant that not a penny of this helps China to get ahead of us,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Congress Tuesday.If funding recipients violate restrictions, Commerce Department can claw back federal awards.Raimondo told Congress she is working as fast as possible to get awards approved.""I feel the pressure,"" Raimondo said. ""We are behind but it is more important that we get it right. And if we take another month or a few more weeks to get it right, I will defend that because it's necessary.""The regulation prohibits funding recipients from significantly expanding semiconductor manufacturing capacity in foreign countries of concern for 10 years. It also restricts recipients from some joint research or technology licensing efforts with foreign entities of concern but allows for international standards, patent licensing, and utilizing foundry and packaging services.The final rules prohibit material expansion of semiconductor manufacturing capacity for leading-edge and advanced facilities in foreign countries of concern for 10 years. It also clarifies wafer production is included within semiconductor manufacturing.The final rule ties expanded semiconductor manufacturing capacity to adding cleanroom or other physical space, defining material expansions as increasing production capacity by more than 5%.The rule prohibits recipients from adding new cleanroom space or production lines that result in expanding a facility’s production capacity beyond 10%.The rule also classifies some semiconductors as critical to national security, triggering tighter restrictions, including quantum computing current-generation and mature-node chips, in radiation-intensive environments, and for other specialized military capabilities.

8,"No volatility jump in Indian bonds after JPMorgan inclusion, says BlackRock ",2023-09-22 04:11:00-04:00,") - Indian bond markets won't see a jump in volatility in the near-term after JPMorgan announced India's inclusion in its widely tracked emerging market debt index, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s head of Asia Pacific fixed income said on Friday.JPMorgan said 23 Indian Government Bonds (IGBs) with a combined notional value of $330 billion were eligible for inclusion in its Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) index and index suite, benchmarked by about $236 billion in global funds.Neeraj Seth, chief investment officer and head of APAC fundamental fixed income at BlackRock, expects inflows of around $20 billion to $25 billion into India after the maximum weight threshold of 10% is achieved on the GBI-EM index.Given the size of the $2 trillion global government bond market, it may add only a little bit to the volatility in Indian bond markets, Seth told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.The volatility would become ""more profound and visible"" if foreign ownership were to go into double digits, Seth said, adding that he expected foreign ownership of Indian government bonds to rise to 3.0%-3.5% post-inclusion.""I don't think that's significant enough to move the markets around,"" he said.Foreign investor buying in Indian bonds has remained tepid with net purchases of $3.4 billion so far in 2023. Foreign investors own less than 2% of outstanding government debt.Separately, Seth believes there will be a shift in asset allocations as markets head into 2024, which he sees becoming a ""very attractive year"", especially for U.S. fixed income, with investors looking to lock-in yields as the Fed wraps up its hiking cycle.He also pointed to investment-grade credit in Asia and higher quality emerging market bonds, in a ""tilt towards quality"" as macro uncertainties persist.(Join GMF, a chat room hosted on Refinitiv Messenger: )

U.S. stock futures predominantly rose on Friday, September 22, 2023, marking a notable shift following two consecutive days of selling in response to the Federal Reserve's revised interest-rate outlook for the upcoming year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures experienced a minor dip of 7 points to settle at 34330, while S&P 500 futures climbed 5 points to reach 4377. Nasdaq 100 futures saw a more significant increase, rising 46 points to hit 14908.This rise followed Thursday's market downturn where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.08%, the S&P 500 declined by 1.64%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 1.82%. Over the past three days, the S&P 500 has seen a total decrease of 2.8%.The Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates but increase the median projection for expected rates in 2024 by half a point triggered the selling spree earlier this week. This decision led to Wall Street experiencing its most significant slump in half a year as 10-year benchmark Treasury yields reached 4.5% for the first time since 2007.Thursday also saw an unexpected drop in jobless claims, which drove the two-year Treasury yield to its highest level since 2006 and pushed the ten-year yield to its highest since 2007. As a result, the likelihood of future rate cuts has now decreased to just 75 basis points.Despite the bearish trend, strategists from Saxo Bank noted that both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 closed at technical support levels, suggesting a potential for minor rebounding.In other economic news, this week the Bank of Japan decided to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy stance. This decision resulted in some gains for the dollar against the yen.

11,Ukraine to launch joint weapons production with US - Zelenskiy ,2023-09-22 01:12:00-04:00,") - Ukraine and the United States have agreed to launch joint weapons production in a step that will enable Kyiv to start producing air defence systems, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday as he wrapped up a visit to the U.S.In his daily address to Ukrainians, Zelenskiy said the long-term agreement would create jobs and a new industrial base in Ukraine, whose economy has been devastated by Russia's invasion and war.""It was a very important visit to Washington, very important results,"" Zelenskiy said in a video posted on the presidential website on Friday morning.""And a long-term agreement - we will work together so that Ukraine produces the necessary weapons together with the United States. Co-production in the defence (sector) with the United States is a historic thing.""Kyiv has stepped up efforts to boost domestic weapons production as much as possible because 19 months of war has created a huge demand for arms and ammunition to fend off Russian attacks along a 1,000 km (620 mile) front line. Russian air strikes across Ukraine have caused widespread damage and killed many people.Zelenskiy said the Ministry for Strategic Industries, which oversees weapons production in Ukraine, had signed cooperation agreements with three associations, uniting over 2,000 defence U.S. companies, on future possible work in Ukraine.""We are preparing to create a new defence ecosystem with the United States to produce weapons to strengthen further freedom and protect life together,"" Zelenskiy said without disclosing more details.Ukraine depends heavily on Western military support. To reduce its dependence, Zelenskiy and his team have been pushing for reforms in the domestic defence industry to modernise local producers and increase supplies to the front.Zelenskiy has said previously that Kyiv will soon host an international arms production forum, inviting companies from over 20 countries.The government is also implementing reforms at its main weapons production company - Ukroboronprom - to improve transparency, boost production capacity and enable it to cooperate more actively with Western producers.Ukraine has already agreed several joint projects with central European producers to repair Ukrainian tanks and other vehicles, and has been working to develop drone and missile production.

13,Qualcomm initiates workforce reduction in Shanghai and Taiwan amid economic uncertainties ,2023-09-22 01:40:00-04:00,"Position added successfully to: 
In response to economic uncertainties and deteriorating U.S.-China technology relations, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) has initiated a workforce reduction at its Shanghai and Taiwan offices. The U.S-based chip giant confirmed on Friday that the restructuring plan, which includes significant workforce reductions, is expected to be completed by March 2024.The company stated that the restructuring is necessary to enable continued investments in key growth and diversification opportunities amid the ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and demand environment. While Qualcomm did not provide specific details regarding the number of employees affected by the layoffs, it did mention that a substantial portion of the restructuring charges could be reflected in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.Qualcomm dismissed rumors of a large-scale office closure or full exit from Shanghai, according to a report by China Business News. Despite facing challenges due to economic uncertainties and weakened demand in consumer electronics, which led to a 23% year-over-year revenue slump to $8.45 billion for the quarter ending June 25, Qualcomm maintains substantial operations in China across 12 cities.The company's decision to trim its workforce comes as it aims to focus on key growth and diversification. However, it did not specify the exact number of layoffs at its Taiwan office. As part of its restructuring plan, Qualcomm is currently developing plans that will primarily consist of workforce reductions.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

14,Apple workers in France stage strike on iPhone 15 launch day ,2023-09-22 01:54:00-04:00,") -Workers at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stores in France began a nationwide strike over pay and working conditions on Friday in a protest designed to coincide with the launch of the iPhone 15. It is the latest headache for the tech giant in France after it was forced to stop selling its iPhone 12 model earlier this month for above-threshold radiation. Apple disputes the findings of the French watchdog.About 30 staff were picketing outside the company's store in Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) in central Paris, one of three in the French capital, a few metres away from a line of about 40 customers waiting in the rain to enter the shop.""We are still the people who make Apple's wealth, and therefore I think that we deserve a little more honorable treatment than what we are given today,"" said Anais Durel, a 36-year old who has worked for Apple for 10 years.Apple declined to comment.Apple unions including CGT, Unsa, CFDT and Cidre-CFTC, which also plan to strike on Saturday, have asked for a 7% wage increase to compensate for inflation, and an end to a months-long hiring freeze. Management did not want to offer more than a 4.5% hike, union officials said.""Inflation is still quite nasty. There are a lot of employees who are experiencing difficulties,"" said Tarek, a CGT union leader who declined to give his last name.""The goal is not at all to block sales of the iPhone, the goal is really to bring awareness to this situation,"" he added.Staff at an Apple store in Barcelona, where about 250 people were queuing to enter the store on Friday morning, were set to join colleagues in France in protesting.About 20 workers will set up an information picket outside the store on Paseo de Gracia in central Barcelona at midday, Pablo Paredes, leader of the CNT Apple union, told Reuters.Paredes said the workers aim to highlight poor working conditions including contracts which do not compensate them for working at weekends or at night.CNT is a minority union and only active in one of Barcelona's two stores. The union has not yet managed to secure a meeting with the company to lodge its complaints, Paredes said.""We have been talking since August to our colleagues on strike in France. In Spain, unlike them, not all the unions have agreed to strike,"" Paredes said.

15,UAW union warns of extended strike against major U.S. automakers ,2023-09-22 01:09:00-04:00,"Position added successfully to:

The United Auto Workers (UAW) union has warned that it may prolong its strike action against the 'Big Three' American automakers, namely General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F), and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), the parent company of Chrysler. The union, which initiated limited strikes at one facility for each car manufacturer on Thursday last week, has stated that more workers will join the strike today if significant progress isn't achieved in negotiations.Analysts Dan Ives from Wedbush and Mike Ward from Benchmark have predicted that a strike expansion is likely due to the apparent gap between the two parties in their negotiations. The UAW's demands include a 40% wage increase over the contract's duration, a shorter workweek without pay reduction, and enhancements to work rules and retirement benefits. In contrast, the automakers are currently offering approximately a 20% pay increase along with cost of living adjustments and some concessions on work rules and retirement funding.The potential extension of strikes could impact key facilities such as GM's Fort Wayne plant in Indiana, which manufactures Chevrolet Silverados; Stellantis' Sterling Heights assembly plant in Michigan, which builds Dodge Ram trucks; and Ford's profitable truck plants in Dearborn, Michigan, and Kansas City, Missouri. An even more damaging scenario would be if the union decides to strike a powertrain plant that supplies multiple assembly plants, effectively shutting them all down.GM President Mark Ruess expressed his concerns about misinformation surrounding the negotiations in an op-ed published on Wednesday. However, UAW president Shawn Fain has rejected proposals from the auto manufacturers and has not yet responded to requests for comments about potential strike expansion plans.The ongoing strike is seen as an attempt by the UAW to unify its members after challenging times marked by the credit crisis, GM bankruptcy, and foreign competition. From 2009 to 2019, wages rose at about 1% per year on average, excluding profit-sharing, according to the Federal Reserve. Over the same period, the U.S. market share of the 'Big Three' dropped from around 45% to 40%.In response to this decline, Ford and GM are planning to regain market share with electric vehicles, especially in the truck and commercial fleet markets. However, increased labor costs could potentially hinder their ability to gain a larger share in the EV market.Since July, when labor issues began to impact investor sentiment, shares in Ford and GM have fallen by around 19% and 15% respectively. On the other hand, Stellantis stock has risen by approximately 10%, although it remains a cheaper stock, trading at less than four times estimated 2024 earnings.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

16,"Rupert Murdoch exit may give Trump a Fox News 'reset,' Republican strategists say ",2023-09-22 01:03:00-04:00,") - Rupert Murdoch's departure as the chairman of Fox Corp and News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) could provide an opportunity to mend the relationship between former President Donald Trump and Fox News as the 2024 election campaign heats up, said a former adviser to Trump and Republican strategists.A mutually beneficial relationship between Trump and Fox News broke down after the 2020 election in the wake of the network's coverage of the election and the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol Hill riot by Trump supporters that left five dead and injured more than 140 police officers. Fox chose in April to settle a defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million over its amplification of Trump's false vote-rigging claims in the 2020 election, which legal experts said was the largest settlement ever struck by an American media company.Rupert Murdoch's son, Lachlan Murdoch, will become the sole chairman of News Corp and continue as the chair and CEO of Fox, the companies said on Thursday, raising questions about how Fox's political coverage may change ahead of the 2024 Republican primaries and presidential election.Fox News continues to be the number one U.S. cable news network, playing an influential role in U.S. politics. Republicans prize its conservative-leaning audience, but critics accuse it of bias and say it has made U.S. politics more toxic. Trump is far and away the front-runner for the Republican nomination. If he is selected as the Republican nominee, he would face Biden in a November 2024 general election. ""This provides an opportunity for a reset between President Trump and the Fox News network,"" Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said of Lachlan Murdoch's appointment. ""The question is: does Lachlan Murdoch want to have a positive relationship with former President Donald Trump? Or does he want to see how things play out?""Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment about political coverage under Lachlan Murdoch. Trump does still appear occasionally on Fox News, and gave an interview to the network's chief political anchor, Bret Baier, in June. An aide to Donald Trump said any response to Rupert Murdoch stepping down would come from Trump himself on his Truth Social media platform. Trump had not made any comment by Thursday evening.Jason Osborne, an adviser to the former Republican president's 2016 campaign, said he hoped Lachlan Murdoch and other Fox executives would seek to boost Trump coverage and that both sides could mend ties. ""The only path up is regaining those viewers that they lost. And the viewers that they lost veer more towards Trump,"" Osborne said. ""I think there will be outreach if it hasn't already occurred.""Fox executives in 2021 decided to more forcefully rebut Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him through voter fraud, a conspiracy theory that fueled the Capitol Hill riot. Fox lost Trump-supporting viewers to smaller, right-wing cable networks such as Newsmax and One America News Network after the decision. NOT 2016 AGAIN Fox was a cheerleader for Trump in his ultimately successful 2016 White House campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton, a symbiotic relationship that continued up to the 2020 election. Trump boosted Fox's ratings, while Fox boosted Trump politically, said Larry Stuelpnagel, an associate professor of journalism and political science at Northwestern (NASDAQ:NWE) University and a former broadcast journalist.Dan Cassino, a politics professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, said he does not believe Fox's coverage of Trump will return to 2016 levels. But he added indications are that Lachlan Murdoch is not anti-Trump and as Trump remains the front-runner, coverage of him will likely be ""high volume"".During the Dominion litigation, documents emerged in which Lachlan Murdoch instructed Fox News executives to rein in critical coverage of Trump after he lost the 2020 election. Analysts said those could be heat-of-the-moment instructions over ratings, rather than a vision for how he wanted to cover Trump in the future.Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist, said Fox's support of Trump's election lies had been costly, but she was skeptical the network would fundamentally change when it comes to Trump. ""Their coverage continues to peddle in misinformation and conspiracy theories,"" Finney said.Stuelpnagel said he believed the high cost of the Dominion lawsuit might make Lachlan Murdoch tread carefully on Trump coverage.""The Dominion lawsuit cost them dearly,"" Stuelpnagel said. ""I think Lachlan is going to be more cautious in how he deals with Trump. I don't see a wholesale change in the direction of network.""

20,Apple's flagship Shanghai store buzzes as iPhone 15 goes on sale ,2023-09-21 22:13:00-04:00,") - Over a hundred customers queued inside Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s flagship store in the Chinese financial hub of Shanghai on Friday, waiting to pick up their iPhone 15 orders on the first day of in-store availability.How Apple's latest iPhone sells in China is under close scrutiny by fans and market watchers alike, after widening curbs on iPhone use by government staff and the release of a high-end rival from domestic manufacturer Huawei sparked concern about demand for the device in its third-largest market.But the strength of pre-orders in the world's second-largest economy, which began last Friday, has eased worries, with delivery times pushed into November and the premium iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max selling out in just one minute on  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s Tmall e-commerce site.Local media reported the queue at the store on Shanghai's East Nanjing road shopping belt started forming at 5 a.m. (1000 GMT).Among those at the store was social media influencer Zhang Ming, 25, who said she wanted to try out the iPhone 15 after being unsuccessful in pre-ordering online.""I always like to look (at the new devices). When I buy Apple products I only look at the colour. If I like the colour I will buy it,"" she said.The iPhone 15 includes a new titanium shell, a faster chip and improved videogame-playing abilities. Apple also surprised by not raising prices, reflecting the global smartphone slump.But some customers at the store lamented the lack of significant upgrades from the previous model. Real estate worker Wang Puyu, 29, said he was only purchasing a new model because he had promised to give his iPhone 14 to his nephew.""I normally upgrade every year. But this year, I am not very satisfied.""

21,Dow futures edge higher; on course for sharp weekly losses ,2023-09-21 15:36:00-04:00," -- U.S. stock futures traded marginally higher Friday, but were on course to post hefty weekly losses in the wake of the Federal Reserve signaling it expected to keep interest rates higher for longer.By 06:20 ET (10:20 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 25 points, or 0.1%, S&P 500 Futures traded 10 points, or 0.2%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 65 points, or 0.4%.The main indices on Wall Street closed sharply lower Thursday, as surging bond yields in the wake of the Fed meeting, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbing to its highest level since 2007, weighed heavily. This has pressured the highly-indebted tech sector, with the Nasdaq Composite on track to drop 3.5% this week, which would be its worst week since March. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average stands 1.6% lower so far this week, while the broad-based S&P 500 is on course to drop 2.7%.The Fed held rates steady this week, but signaled it might raise them one more time this year and keep them elevated for longer than anticipated as it tries to slay inflation. The U.S. central bank Fed officials also signaled two rate cuts next year, half the number they anticipated in their last round of forecasts in June.The U.S. economic data slate will center around the purchasing managers index reports for September on Friday, with the S&P Global U.S. manufacturing index expected to show a reading of 48, still in contraction territory, while the services index is tipped to come in at a healthy 50.6.The equivalent data released earlier in Europe indicated that the eurozone economy will likely contract in the third quarter, with the flash composite index coming in at 47.1 in September, a slight improvement from August's 33-month low of 46.7.In corporate news, the U.K. competition regulator signaled that Microsoft’s potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) may now be approved.This followed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) restructuring its proposal, proposing the divestment of cloud rights for existing Activision games, including the popular “Call of Duty”, to French game publisher Ubisoft Entertainment.Investors will also be keeping an eye on negotiations to end the UAW strike impacting the major U.S. auto manufacturers, while a U.S. government shutdown draws nearer with the midnight Sept. 30 deadline on a funding deal just over a week away and no agreement between the two political parties in sight.Oil prices rose Friday on growing expectations of tighter supplies, following the previous session's news that Russia has banned exports of gasoline and diesel with immediate effect to stabilize the domestic fuel market.This added to an already tight supply situation as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies maintained previously announced production cuts.By 06:20 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $90.70 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 1% to $94.25. Additionally, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,945.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.0636.(Oliver Gray contributed to this

22,"Trump, NY attorney general to argue over scope of looming fraud trial ",2023-09-22 02:17:00-04:00,") - Donald Trump's lawyers on Friday will try to persuade a New York judge to throw out, just 10 days before a scheduled trial, most or all of state Attorney General Letitia James's lawsuit accusing the former U.S. president of ""staggering"" fraud.Lawyers for James, in contrast, will ask the same Manhattan judge to find Trump and other defendants, including his adult sons and his Trump Organization family business, liable for fraud even before a jury starts hearing evidence.The looming trial comes as Trump enjoys a dominating lead in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing a slew of litigation including four criminal indictments where he has pleaded not guilty.Justice Arthur Engoron is reviewing James' claims that Trump repeatedly lied in financial statements to obtain better terms on loans and insurance.James has accused Trump of overstating the values of more than 20 properties from 2011 to 2021, including his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and Trump Tower penthouse in Manhattan, and inflating his own fortune by as much as $3.6 billion.""Based on the undisputed evidence, no trial is required for the court to determine that defendants presented grossly and materially inflated asset values,"" and used them to defraud banks and insurers, James has said.Trump has called the lawsuit a ""witch hunt.""His lawyers have argued that James has no authority to sue over private transactions they say were not fraudulent, and that most of her claims fall outside statutes of limitations.They cited a June decision by a state appeals court dismissing claims against Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, and various other claims predating July 2014 or February 2016.The court left it to Engoron to determine which parts could proceed.Last week, Trump accused James of ignoring the decision and Engoron of refusing to implement it, and said the trial should be delayed.That prompted an appeals court judge on Sept. 14 to temporarily stay the trial. A five-judge panel is expected to decide next week whether the trial should proceed.Engoron has chosen not to appear before the panel, and referred it to his prior orders. On Thursday, James called Trump's request for a delay a ""brazen and meritless"" attempt to undermine Engoron's authority.She said even a brief delay ""would likely wreak havoc"" on the trial and other trials that Trump faces.James' lawsuit seeks to bar Trump and his adult sons Donald Jr. And Eric from running businesses in New York. It also seeks at least $250 million of penalties.

24,Bank AL Habib announces plans to establish a wholly-owned exchange company ,2023-09-22 02:40:00-04:00,"Bank AL Habib Limited, one of Pakistan's largest commercial banks, has announced its plan to establish an Exchange Company (EC) as a wholly-owned subsidiary. This development, shared with the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday, makes Bank AL Habib the fourth bank in recent weeks to make such an announcement.The establishment of this EC was approved by the Board of Directors of Bank AL Habib Limited through a circular resolution dated September 19, 2023. The authorized share capital for the EC is set at Rs1 billion ($5.6 million). However, the establishment is subject to approval and clearance by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and completion of other regulatory compliance requirements.This move follows similar announcements made by MCB Bank Limited, Meezan Bank Limited, and United Bank Limited (UBL), who have also declared their intentions to establish wholly-owned ECs. The decision comes in the wake of the SBP's bid to strengthen controls amid a significant fall in the rupee's value in the open market. As part of these structural reforms, leading banks actively engaged in foreign exchange business are encouraged to establish wholly-owned ECs.The SBP has also raised the minimum capital requirement for ECs from Rs200 million to Rs500 million, effectively raising the barrier for private sector entry into this field.Bank AL Habib's announcement coincides with its recent financial results showing substantial growth in core earnings. The bank reported a 69% year-on-year increase in Profit Before Tax (PBT) for the half-year ending on June 30, 2023, which hit Rs31.14 billion.

The two Royal Norwegian Air Force aircraft landed in Tervo, central Finland, on Thursday afternoon as part of a military exercise.Immediately after landing, refuelling was carried out with the engines running, a so-called ""hotpit refuelling"", the Norwegian military said, before the planes took off again.""Fighter jets are vulnerable on the ground, so by being able to use small airfields – and now motorways – (this) increases our survivability in war,"" Major General Rolf Folland, chief of the Royal Norwegian Air Force, said in the statement.Finland, which joined NATO in April, shares a 1,300 km (810 mile) border with Russia. Norway is a founding member of the alliance.Another type of F-35, the F-35B which is able to land vertically, has landed on roads before. This was a first for this particular version of the F-35 jet, which cannot land vertically.F-16s are also able to land on roads.Finland is planning to buy 64 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin.

London-based data and analytics company, Ascential, experienced a significant surge in its stock value on Friday due to an announcement of improved earnings for the first half of 2023. The firm's shares rose by up to 14%, propelled by a significant reduction in its pretax loss and a rise in adjusted pretax profit.Ascential reported a pretax loss of £11.8 million ($14.5 million) in the first half of the year, marking a substantial decrease from the £41.6 million loss recorded during the same period in 2022. By 05:16 ET (09:16 GMT) on Friday, the company's shares were trading 10.50 pence higher at 200.80 pence.In addition to the reduced pretax loss, Ascential also reported an increase in adjusted pretax profit, which excludes exceptional and one-off items. The figure rose to £49.8 million from £48.4 million a year earlier, signaling a positive financial trend for the firm.The company attributes these favorable results to an increase in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). This figure rose to £78.6 million from £67.2 million, largely due to strong performances from Ascential's Lions and WGSN units.Revenue also saw a significant uptick, escalating to £307.4 million from £260.7 million. This growth was bolstered by robust expansion across all company segments.Despite potential challenges posed by macroeconomic uncertainties and currency fluctuations that could impact their industries, Ascential maintains an optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year, citing several growth avenues available to it.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

27,"McDonald's to raise royalty fees for new restaurant operators in US, Canada ",2023-09-22 03:08:00-04:00,") -McDonald's is raising royalty fees for new franchise operators in the United States and Canada for the first time in nearly three decades, according to an internal letter viewed by Reuters on Friday.The burger giant is hiking the fees that franchise owners pay for the brand to 5% from 4%, starting Jan. 1, for any new restaurants they open.The change will not affect existing franchisees who are maintaining their current footprint or who buy a franchised location from another operator. It will also not apply to rebuild existing locations or restaurants transferred between family members.The revised rate ""will help us maintain our competitive edge – so we can continue offering opportunity to independent small business owners and their families"", according to the letter.The fast-food giant operates more than 13,000 locations across the United States, with 95% of the restaurants run by franchisees as of Dec. 31, making up nearly 30% of its total revenue in 2022.Average cash flows for these U.S. franchisees have grown more than 35% over the past five years, the letter showed.The company will also change the term for payments from ""service fees"" to ""royalty fees"", used by all other McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) markets around the world.Royalty is a fee paid by restaurant operators to the owner and the rate is set based on the revenue generated by the licensed property.McDonald's had said in July it expects revenue growth to moderate in the second half of the year as signs of easing inflation prompt it to temper menu prices, even as it reported better-than-expected quarterly profit.

A recent study led by Jay Sole, UBS U.S. Softline and Luxury Analyst, suggests a potential decrease in consumer spending on items such as clothing and accessories due to prevailing economic uncertainties. This trend, predicted for the upcoming months, could potentially impact a wide array of softline companies.The research, published on Friday, indicates that all demographic groups might be affected by this downturn in spending. The anticipated change comes as consumers grapple with issues like inflation and student loan repayments, causing them to rethink their spending plans.UBS research also highlights potential implications for clothing stocks. The bank has adopted a bearish outlook due to the expected dip in consumer spending. This trend could pose challenges for stock prices in the sector, affecting a broad range of companies, although specific firms likely to be most impacted were not disclosed.Despite these challenges, there seems to be a silver lining for consumers. The slowdown in demand coincides with an inventory build-up, which could lead to increased promotions. This situation may provide opportunities for shoppers to benefit from deals and discounts.The research was based on conversations with consumers about their future spending intentions, focusing on discretionary items like apparel, footwear, and accessories.

Barclays maintained their Equal Weight rating on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) with a 12-month price target of $260.00 on the EV stock ahead of the company’s 3Q delivery results. Tesla is expected to report 3Q delivery results on October 3rd.Analysts expect Tesla to report 3Q deliveries of 455K units, falling short of both the consensus forecast of 463,000 and the previously published estimate of 483,000. This projection also signifies a decrease compared to the second quarter of 2023, when Tesla delivered 466,000 units.Barclays analysts wrote in a note, “Our estimate implies a sharp step down in September deliveries vs. Jun’23. While Jul/Aug’23 tracked at an est. 285k units (up from 255k in Apr/May’23), we nevertheless assume 170k in Sep., down from 212k in Jun’23.”Barclays' estimate for 3Q deliveries takes into account recent discussions regarding production speed, which offer some insight into the expected delivery volume for this period. Specifically, delivery projections rely on a production assumption of approximately 435,000 units, along with a reduction in inventory by 20,000 units.A Tesla tweet on September 17th announced that they had produced their 5 millionth vehicle the previous week. An earlier post on Weibo pinpointed the milestone as being achieved on September 16th. Assuming the accuracy of the Weibo post's timing and considering Tesla's historical production rates, along with assumptions about weekly production for the rest of September, Barclays' forecast for Tesla's third-quarter 2023 production stands at 435,000 units.Shares of TSLA are up 1.02% in premarket trading Friday morning.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/barclays-expects-tesla-to-report-3q-delivery-miss-432SI-3180635,investing.com,2023-09-22,"['barclays', 'expect', 'tesla', 'report', 'delivery', 'miss', 'position', 'add', 'successfully', 'barclays', 'maintain', 'equal', 'weight', 'rating', 'tesla', 'nasdaq', 'tsla', 'price', 'target', 'ev', 'stock', 'ahead', 'company', 'delivery', 'result', 'tesla', 'expect', 'report', 'delivery', 'result', 'october', 'expect', 'tesla', 'report', 'deliveries', 'unit', 'fall', 'short', 'consensus', 'forecast', 'previously', 'publish', 'estimate', 'this', 'projection', 'also', 'signify', 'decrease', 'compare', 'second', 'quarter', 'tesla', 'deliver', 'analyst', 'write', 'note', 'our', 'estimate', 'implies', 'sharp', 'step', 'september', 'delivery', 'jun', 'while', 'track', 'est', 'unit', 'nevertheless', 'assume', 'jun', 'barclays', 'estimate', 'delivery', 'take', 'account', 'recent', 'discussion', 'regard', 'production', 'speed', 'offer', 'insight', 'expect', 'delivery', 'volume', 'period', 'specifically', 'delivery', 'projection', 'rely', 'production', 'assumption', 'approximately', 'unit', 'along', 'reduction', 'inventory', 'tesla', 'tweet', 'september', 'announce', 'produced', 'millionth', 'vehicle', 'previous', 'week', 'an', 'early', 'post', 'weibo', 'pinpoint', 'milestone', 'achieve', 'september', 'assuming', 'accuracy', 'weibo', 'post', 'timing', 'consider', 'tesla', 'historical', 'production', 'rate', 'along', 'assumption', 'weekly', 'production', 'rest', 'september', 'barclays', 'forecast', 'tesla', 'production', 'stand', 'tsla', 'premarket', 'trading', 'friday', 'morning']"

Despite facing an economic downturn, Visa (NYSE:V), the globally recognized credit card processing platform, has exhibited a promising performance. The company has seen a 36% rise from bear-market lows since late September 2022 and is gearing up for further gains. This Friday, Visa reported that it processed 54 billion transactions in the past quarter, generating $3.8 trillion in commerce and yielding $8.1 billion in revenue, marking a 12% increase year over year.Visa's business model, which operates as a payment intermediary rather than a lender, shields it from potential pitfalls such as rising prices and record-high credit card balances. It manages a network of merchants and cardholders, retaining a small percentage of every transaction. Consequently, Visa remains unaffected by delinquencies and charge-offs which are absorbed by the issuing banks.However, it is important to note that Visa is not entirely immune to economic downturns. Weak economies can impact card-based spending by consumers and corporations. This risk is relatively minor due to the shift from cash to card payments. According to data from the Federal Reserve, last year only 18% of payments within the United States were cash-based compared to 60% completed with credit or debit cards. This significant change from 2014's figures demonstrates an ongoing shift towards card usage.In its effort to remain competitive and innovative, Visa has established Innovation Centers worldwide to foster industry advancements tailored to local markets. For instance, its Africa Innovation Center has successfully launched a small business card-acceptance solution and a digital wallet compatible with any bank.Furthermore, Visa is venturing into cryptocurrency partnerships to facilitate digital currency spending. The company recently launched a new platform through its Currencycloud arm to simplify cross-border payments - an area projected by the Bank of England to grow from $150 trillion in 2017 to $250 trillion by 2027.Visa's stock has shown resilience, bouncing back from occasional setbacks to even higher highs. The stock has seen consistent rallies that have driven gains past 36% since October 2022. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

32,"'Power, influence, notoriety': The Gen-Z hackers who struck MGM, Caesars ",2023-09-22 02:09:00-04:00,") - About a year ago, the U.S. security firm Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) began to hear from a flurry of companies that had been hacked in ways that weren't the norm for cybercriminals. Native English-speaking hackers would call up a target company’s information technology helpdesk posing as an employee, and seek login details by pretending to have lost theirs. They had all the employee information needed to sound convincing. And once they got access, they’d quickly find their way into the company's most sensitive repositories to steal that data for extortion.Ransomware attacks are not new, but this group was extraordinarily skilled at social engineering and bypassing multi-factor authentication, said Wendi Whitmore, senior vice president for the security firm Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team, which has responded to several intrusions tied to the group.""They are much more sophisticated than many cybercriminal actors. They appear to be disciplined and organized in their attacks,"" she said. ""And that's something we typically see more frequently with nation-state actors, versus cyber criminals.""Known in the security industry variously as Scattered Spider, Muddled Libra, and UNC3944, these hackers were thrust into the limelight earlier this month for breaching the systems of two of the world's largest gambling companies - MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) and Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment Ltd.Behind the scenes, it has hit many more companies, according to analysts tracking the intrusions - and cybersecurity specialists expect the attacks to continue. The FBI is investigating the MGM and Caesars breaches, and the companies did not comment on who may be behind them.From Canada to Japan, the security firm CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has tracked 52 attacks globally by the group since March 2022, most of them in the United States, said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of threat intelligence at the company. Google-owned intelligence firm Mandiant, has logged more than 100 intrusions by it in the last two years. Nearly every industry, from telecommunications to finance, hospitality, and media, has been hit. Reuters was not able to determine how much money the hackers may have extorted.But it's not just the scale or the breadth of attacks that make this group stand out. They're extremely good at what they do and ""ruthless"" in their interactions with victims, said Kevin Mandia, Mandiant's founder.The speed at which they breach and exfiltrate data from company systems can overwhelm security response teams, and they have left threatening notes for staff of victim organizations on their systems, and contacted them by text and email in the past, Mandiant found.In some cases - Mandia did not say which ones - hackers tied to Scattered Spider placed bogus emergency calls to summon heavily armed police units to the homes of executives of targeted companies. The technique, called SWATing, ""is something that’s utterly dreadful to live through as a victim,"" he said. ""I don’t even think these intrusions are about money. I think they’re about power, influence and notoriety. That makes it harder to respond to.""Reuters couldn't immediately reach the hacking group for comment. 17-22 YEAR OLDS There's little detail on Scattered Spider's location or identity. Based on the criminals’ chats with victims and clues gleaned from breach investigations, CrowdStrike's Meyers said they are largely 17-22 years-olds. Mandiant estimates they’re mainly from Western countries, but it's unclear how many people are involved. Before calling helpdesks, the hackers acquire employee information including passwords by social engineering, especially 'SIM swapping' - a technique where they trick a telecom company's customer service representative to reassign a specific phone number from one device to another, analysts say.They also appear to make the effort to study how large organizations work, including their vendors and contractors, to find individuals with privileged access they can target, according to analysts. That’s something David Bradbury, chief security officer of the identity management firm Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), saw first-hand last month, when he discovered multiple Okta customers – including MGM – breached by Scattered Spider. Okta provides identity services such as multi-factor authentication used to help users securely access online applications and websites.""The threat actors have clearly taken our courses that we provide online, they've clearly studied our product and how it works,"" Bradbury said. ""This is stuff we haven't seen before."" A larger group named ALPHV said last week it was behind the MGM hack, and analysts believe it provided the software and attack tools for the operation to be carried out by Scattered Spider. Such collaborations are typical for cybercriminals, said Okta's Bradbury. ALPHV, which according to Mandiant is a ""ransomware-as-a-service"", would provide services such as a helpdesk, webpage and branding, and in turn get a cut of whatever Scattered Spider would make from the hack. While many ransomware attacks go unpublicised, the MGM hack was a vivid example of the real-world impact of such incidents. It caused chaos in Las Vegas, as gaming machines stalled and hotel systems were disrupted. Ransomware gangs often function like large organizations, and continue to evolve their methods to adapt to the latest security measures organizations use. ""In some ways this is just like the age-old game of cat and mouse,"" said Whitmore, who compared Scattered Spider to Lapsus$, another group behind previous hacks into Okta and the technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The British police last year arrested seven people between the ages of 16 and 21 following those hacks.

The bank's shares dropped 7.98% to ₹1,529.20 each by Friday from ₹1,661.90 on the previous Thursday. This fall equates to a decline of approximately ₹99,835 crore in market capitalization, bringing the bank's total market cap to ₹11,59,154.60 crore (INR100 crore = approx. $12 million).The bank's share price has been on a four-day consecutive fall due to an unexpected dip in net worth and concerns regarding the quality of assets in the near term, margins, and return on asset (RoA).On Tuesday, September 20, several brokerages adjusted their target prices for HDFC Bank's stock due to these emerging pressures. Kotak Institutional Equities revised their goal from ₹1,925 to ₹1,850; Antique Stock Broking from ₹2,025 to ₹1,925; Phillip Capital from ₹1,960 to ₹1,880; and Nirmal Bang from ₹2,140 to ₹1,935.Emkay Global noted that HDFC Bank is planning for measured growth in the near future. The bank aims at building granular liability to replace HDFC's high-cost borrowing and expanding the mortgage business from the bank's platform. This strategy is expected to normalise margin/RoA and improve RoA/RoE from 1.9%/15.8% in FY24E (merged) to 2% /17.3% by FY26E as merger synergies take effect.JM Financial also adjusted its predictions for HDFC Bank's earnings per share (EPS) for FY24/FY25 by 1-2%, reflecting the lower opening net worth of HDFC.

39,Microcap firms adapt IPO strategies amid challenging capital market ,2023-09-22 03:57:00-04:00,"Facing a challenging capital market landscape, microcap companies have been reassessing their initial public offering (IPO) strategies. Historically, these smaller firms have attempted to meet the stringent listing requirements for the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange, such as having at least $15 million worth of shares held by public shareholders, known as the ""public float"" requirement, through a $15 million IPO.However, stricter listing requirements, heightened regulatory scrutiny, and investor demand for stronger balance sheets have made it increasingly difficult for these companies to raise sufficient capital in recent years. The market for microcap IPOs has also become more selective, with median offering sizes and valuations dropping significantly since 2021.The median offering size fell from $25 million in 2021 to just $8 million in 2023. Simultaneously, the number of microcap issuers who were able to raise at least $15 million in their IPO decreased from 90 (83%) in 2021 to only 12 (25%) so far in 2023. The average public offering price also saw a 30% decline since 2021.In response to these challenges, microcap companies are turning to existing private investors or stakeholders, known as selling shareholders. This strategy involves registering selling shareholders in the company's S-1 registration statement so that their shares can be freely traded upon the IPO and count towards meeting the public float requirement.This approach has seen a significant rise in popularity. In 2021, only 10 issuers (9.2%) registered shares held by selling shareholders in the IPO. However, by 2023, this figure had risen to 17 issuers (28%). In fact, selling shareholders accounted for 24% of the post-IPO public float of such issuers so far this year.The benefits of this strategy include the ability to meet listing requirements, less dilution at depressed valuations, and providing early liquidity for legacy shareholders. However, there are also challenges. For instance, investment bankers and new IPO investors may not favor selling shareholders being registered due to their cost basis often being below the IPO price, which could lead to significant selling on the first day of trading. Additionally, Nasdaq may require extra vetting of the IPO allocation book, potentially delaying the offering.In conclusion, microcap companies are adapting their strategies in response to a challenging IPO market by including selling shareholders in their IPOs. This approach offers an effective solution to meet minimum listing requirements while raising smaller yet sufficient amounts of capital.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Shares of PNB Gilts, a company primarily involved in supporting government borrowing programs, hit a 20% upper circuit on Friday, reaching ₹81 per share on BSE during intraday trading. This surge was triggered by the anticipation of billions of dollars in foreign inflows following India's inclusion in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)'s emerging market index. The stock surpassed its previous 52-week high of ₹71.6 per share set on July 21, 2023.The S&P BSE Sensex, however, was down by 113 points or 0.1 percent to quote at 66,116 levels. On the same day, around three crore shares exchanged hands at both exchanges as compared to the one-month average of seven lakh shares.JPMorgan Chase & Co announced its intention to incorporate Indian government bonds into its benchmark emerging-market index on Friday. This move is expected to attract substantial foreign investments into India's debt market and is scheduled to take effect on June 28, 2024. India will hold a maximum weight of 10 percent in the index which could result in inflows of up to $30 billion.This development comes amidst a period of global economic shifts and market uncertainty. For instance, most Asian markets experienced a sluggish start on September 22 due to a surge in US Treasury yields. Among them, Japan's Nikkei index declined by about one percent ahead of the Bank of Japan's interest rate decision.On the same day, data from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) showed that Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) sold shares worth ₹3,007.36 crore, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DII) bought stocks worth ₹1,158.14 crore (INR100 crore = $12 million).This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

In recent developments, EuroTeleSites, a tower spinoff of Telekom Austria (OTC:TKAGY), made its debut on the Vienna Stock Exchange this Friday. However, the company's shares commenced trading at a price lower than expected, marking a 10% drop from the reference price set by its parent company, Telekom Austria. The initial trading price was €4.31 per share, significantly lower than the reference price of €4.95.This initial trading price resulted in EuroTeleSites' market capitalization being pegged at €716 million ($763.4 million), as reported by the Vienna Stock Exchange. Despite the lower-than-expected debut, the listing of EuroTeleSites is part of a broader trend among European telecom operators to take their telecom-tower companies public. This strategy is seen as an effective way to offload infrastructure assets.On the same day, Telekom Austria's shares also experienced a sharp decline, falling 16% to €6.48. This decrease came after one quarter of EuroTeleSites' reference price was deducted from Telekom Austria's stock price, reflecting the share-distribution ratio between the two entities.Prior to EuroTeleSites' listing, Telekom Austria had announced that its shareholders would receive one share in EuroTeleSites for every four shares they held in Telekom Austria. This move mirrored the share-distribution ratio between the two companies and may have contributed to the decline in Telekom Austria's stock price on Friday.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The new fee, set at $2.99 per month in the U.S., will be required for Prime members who wish to continue watching Prime Video content without ads.Meanwhile, the monthly Prime membership cost will remain unchanged for those who are willing to watch content with ads.Amazon states that introducing ads to Prime Video will enable the company to continue investing in content and potentially increase its content investments over time.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ads-are-coming-to-amazon-prime-video-next-year-stock-pops-432SI-3180483,investing.com,2023-09-22,"['ad', 'come', 'amazon', 'prime', 'video', 'next', 'year', 'stock', 'pop', 'position', 'add', 'successfully', 'ad', 'introduce', 'amazon', 'nasdaq', 'amzn', 'prime', 'video', 'entertainment', 'content', 'include', 'movie', 'series', 'several', 'country', 'company', 'announce', 'rollout', 'set', 'begin', 'germany', 'canada', 'early', 'additional', 'country', 'like', 'france', 'italy', 'spain', 'mexico', 'australia', 'get', 'ad', 'later', 'share', 'rise', 'early', 'friday', 'prime', 'video', 'viewer', 'experience', 'ad', 'exclusive', 'broadcast', 'thursday', 'night', 'football', 'now', 'commercial', 'break', 'expand', 'content', 'state', 'ad', 'load', 'limited', 'suggest', 'amazon', 'cautious', 'overwhelm', 'viewer', 'advertise', 'within', 'stream', 'we', 'aim', 'meaningfully', 'few', 'ad', 'linear', 'tv', 'stream', 'tv', 'provider', 'company', 'say', 'blog', 'prime', 'member', 'enjoy', 'access', 'prime', 'video', 'content', 'part', 'membership', 'face', 'additional', 'fee', 'start', 'next', 'year', 'the', 'new', 'fee', 'set', 'per', 'month', 'require', 'prime', 'member', 'wish', 'continue', 'watch', 'prime', 'video', 'content', 'without', 'monthly', 'prime', 'membership', 'cost', 'remain', 'unchanged', 'willing', 'watch', 'content', 'state', 'introduce', 'ad', 'prime', 'video', 'enable', 'company', 'continue', 'invest', 'content', 'potentially', 'increase', 'content', 'investment', 'time']"

46,United Airlines appoints insider Leskinen as finance chief ,2023-09-22 03:59:00-04:00,") - United Airlines said on Friday it had promoted company insider Michael Leskinen to chief financial officer, nearly four months after Gerry Laderman announced plans to retire in 2024.Leskinen's appointments comes at a time when United is set to benefit from a boom in high-margin international travel, even though early signs show that domestic travel demand might have peaked.In the second quarter, international passenger revenue accounted for about 41% of the airline's total passenger revenue.Leskinen joined the Chicago-based carrier in 2018 as the managing director for investor relations and most recently served as the president of United Airlines Ventures.He also led the team that raised $6.8 billion in financing secured by the airline’s MileagePlus loyalty program, helping the company wade through the pandemic.Earlier, the carrier had announced that Laderman would remain in his role until the appointment of a successor and would serve as an executive vice president of finance until his planned retirement in September next year.The company's stock had risen 16% this year, compared with a 12.8% gain in the S&P 500 index.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s $75 billion bid to acquire Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) has taken a significant step forward, following approval from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Friday. The regulatory body had initially blocked the deal due to concerns over potential stifling of innovation and choice in the cloud gaming sector.In response, Microsoft proposed a revised agreement that includes selling the non-European streaming rights of Activision games to Ubisoft, the publisher of Assassin's Creed. This move is aimed at addressing the CMA's concerns about Microsoft consolidating its dominant position in the cloud gaming market.The CMA stated that this arrangement would prevent key Activision content, such as popular games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, from being monopolized by Microsoft. By allowing Ubisoft, an independent entity, to acquire the cloud streaming rights for Activision's games, the revised agreement is expected to maintain healthy competition in the maturing cloud gaming market.In addition to this restructuring, Microsoft has made several other agreements as part of its strategy to finalize the merger. This includes a decade-long contract with  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) to ensure the continued availability of Activision’s Call of Duty games on PlayStation consoles. To secure approval from the European Commission, Microsoft also agreed to license Activision’s games to rival cloud gaming services.Despite these advancements, the deal has not yet been fully finalized. Microsoft has proposed solutions to address remaining issues raised by the CMA, which will be deliberated upon until October 6th. However, it is increasingly likely that the merger will be finalized before the companies' self-imposed deadline of October 18th.Ahead of market opening on Friday, shares in Microsoft increased by 0.5%, while Activision’s stock indicated a rise of 1.8%. Ubisoft shares also experienced a surge of 3.6% during initial European trading.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Analysts have moved to defend Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) after shares in the chipmaker fell 2.7% on Thursday after the Information reported that Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) executives have reportedly had extensive discussions about discontinuing their partnership with the chipmaker.Accordingly, Google is mulling transitioning to an in-house design by as early as 2027. This decision was influenced by pricing disputes between Google and Broadcom regarding TPUs.Wells Fargo analysts commented that AVGO losing Google “would be a multi-billion dollar annual impact”.“The company's Custom Silicon business which includes the TPU, YouTube video encoding chips, Meta's MTIA, and more has been one of the fastest-growing segments of Broadcom's business which represents several billion dollars a year in revenue; Google TPUs making up the majority,” analysts wrote in a note.On the other hand, BofA analysts believe this article could be a part of the campaign to lower prices and a contract negotiation tactic, rather than something investors should be worried about.“Developing internal chips completely internally by systems/cloud customers is easy to say, but often really hard to do in its practice as Apple recently discovered when it unsuccessfully tried to replace Qualcomm’s 5G modem,” analysts noted.“The choice is either to Buy off the shelf (merchant silicon) from NVDA or others and/or or engage in multiyear custom internal designs (ASIC) in partnerships with the likes of AVGO, MRVL and their Taiwanese peers.

51,Microsoft's Activision acquisition gains provisional approval from U.K.'s CMA ,2023-09-22 01:37:00-04:00,"Position added successfully to: 
Position added successfully to: 
The ongoing saga of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s acquisition of Activision, the maker of Call of Duty, has taken a positive turn this Friday with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provisionally approving the deal. This development comes in the wake of Ubisoft’s involvement in acquiring Activision’s cloud gaming rights, a move that seems to have allayed the CMA’s initial concerns about cloud gaming competition.The CMA had previously blocked the sale due to apprehensions about Microsoft gaining too much control over cloud gaming. However, Microsoft's decision to sell Activision's cloud gaming rights to Ubisoft appears to have mitigated these fears. ""While the CMA has identified limited residual concerns with the new deal, Microsoft has put forward remedies which the CMA has provisionally concluded should address these issues,"" reads a statement on the CMA's website.This provisional approval is not yet final as the CMA must now consult on the remedies before making a final decision. Nevertheless, it is seen as a significant win for Xbox, making their acquisition of Activision more probable by the October 18 deadline. Brad Smith, Microsoft Vice Chair and President, expressed optimism about this development on Twitter: “We are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA's review process.”Activision CEO Bobby Kotick also shared his enthusiasm for the developments in a company-wide email: “As I said when we announced the deal, this transaction will help us accelerate our ambitions for the future of gaming and enable us to better serve our players. Microsoft recognises the commitment to excellence and creative independence that has served us well for the last 30 years.""The new agreement stipulates that Ubisoft will retain cloud streaming rights for all Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) games now and in the next fifteen years. Gamers who wish to stream Activision games through the cloud will need to use Ubisoft's services, and Microsoft will have to negotiate terms with Ubisoft to add cloud streaming of these games to their services.The CMA has scheduled a consultation until October 6, 2023, to address any remaining concerns about the deal.

52,Republican-proposed attacks on Mexican cartels could lead to American casualties | Reuters,2023-09-22 06:10:00-04:00,") - Sending troops or firing missiles into Mexico to battle cartels, as proposed by Republican 2024 presidential candidates including former President Donald Trump, could lead to casualties and bloody reprisals on American soil without stemming the flow of illegal drugs, current and former U.S. military and government officials told Reuters.Trump, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley are among several Republican candidates who have said they might authorize military force in Mexico - should they win the election - to stem the flood of the cheap and potent synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States.Fentanyl seizures at the southern U.S. border have exploded in recent years, rising from just 10.7 kg (24 lb) in 2014 to around 8,400 kg (18,500 lb) in 2022, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.Almost 80,000 Americans died from opioid-related overdoses in 2022, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, with fentanyl being the primary culprit.But sending troops into America's top trade partner risks failing for several reasons, the current and former military and State Department officials said.They argued that cartels could retaliate in U.S. territory and U.S. troops and Mexican civilians could die in firefights with heavily armed cartel members. Mexico would likely cut off cooperation with U.S. law enforcement, while fentanyl labs are hard to locate.In any case, most fentanyl is smuggled by U.S. citizens.""You send over a SEAL team. You take out a cartel leader. Okay, now who's in charge? This could create the blowback effect of fracturing the cartels,"" said a U.S. military officer with experience in Mexico, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""We create more and more violent splinter groups that are harder to contain.""The officer said cross-border U.S. raids could ignite gunbattles with cartel gunmen armed with military weapons, including machine guns and rocket launchers.""This is just a much more sophisticated enforcement problem than I think a lot of people understand,"" said Earl Anthony Wayne, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico and fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center think tank.Fentanyl labs are ""hard to find,"" he said. ""But it's easy to hit the wrong apartment and kill a bunch of innocents next door, kids, families.""As an example of what could happen, the military officer pointed to January gunbattles in the city of Culiacan between cartel gunmen and Mexican soldiers during the arrest of a son of jailed kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. At least 10 troops and 19 gunmen died.Jason Blazakis, a former State Department official who worked on counterterrorism and counternarcotics issues, said cartels could respond to U.S. special forces raids by having their operatives attack civilians in the United States. He is running in the 2024 congressional election for a New Jersey-based seat as a Democrat.In practice, a significant amount of fentanyl is smuggled by Americans via legal border crossings - making the use of deadly force against smugglers politically unpalatable and almost certainly illegal.A U.S. military spokesman declined to comment on the proposals, saying: ""This is a hypothetical, and it is against our policy to speculate about hypotheticals.""Trump raised the idea of launching military strikes into Mexico in the final year of his presidency.According to a memoir by Mark Esper, Trump's second defense secretary, Trump asked at least twice in 2020 if the military could ""shoot missiles into Mexico to destroy drug labs.""Esper wrote that he replied that it would be illegal and an act of war.But Republican strategists say the calls for military action have intensified during the Republican presidential primary campaign as the fentanyl epidemic worsens.""We're not going to wait. We're not going to let any more Americans die,"" Haley told Reuters in an interview earlier this month.""Either (Mexico) does it, or we do it. But one of us is doing it.""In a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, 52% of respondents supported ""sending U.S. military personnel to Mexico to fight against drug cartels,"" while 26% were opposed. Republicans were supportive by a 64% to 28% margin.Still, most Americans - including most Republicans - said they would oppose such actions if the Mexican government did not approve, the poll found.""It's Hollywood. It looks great. We could do it. It would be easy to send them in, a couple of (special forces) teams that could go and extract in extraordinary renditions,"" said the military officer. ""But the question is why? There's no real purpose to it.""The odds of any Republican ordering unilateral military action once in office probably are slim due to the negative collateral effects such an action would have, strategists told Reuters.""That said, I think if Trump was able to kill a major drug dealer the political benefits would be real,"" said Alex Conant, an adviser to Republican Senator Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign.Sergio Alcocer, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister responsible for North America, said such a move would hamper intelligence-sharing on organized crime and immigration and damage economic relations.""It's unacceptable for Mexico,"" Alcocer said, ""just as it would be on the other side if we were to do it.""",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-republicans-mexico/analysis-republican-proposed-attacks-on-mexican-cartels-could-lead-to-american-casualties-idUSKBN30S0P7,reuters,2023-09-22,"['attack',

53,"Exclusive: At least 40% of Colombia's ELN rebels seen rejecting peace deal, security sources say | Reuters",2023-09-22 07:05:00-04:00,") - At least 40% of fighters from Colombia's National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels could reject a potential peace deal being negotiated with the government, three high-level security sources told Reuters, citing reluctance to surrender profits from drug smuggling and illegal mining.The estimate puts at risk ambitious plans by the country's first leftist leader, President Gustavo Petro, to end Colombia's six-decade war, which has killed 450,000 people, through accords with rebels and criminal groups.The formation of dissident groups by ELN members would echo what was seen after a 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group, when hundreds of holdouts rejected the agreement and to this day continue illegal activities and fighting.It would also appear to undermine repeated reassurances by ELN leaders that the group is united behind talks. The group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The atomized command structure of the ELN has long been a concern for security analysts and critics of the talks, who have warned the group's most radical units are unlikely to adhere to an accord.The three security sources said some 2,300 of the ELN's total 5,850 members were seen as likely to reject the deal.Most of them number among the group's 3,000 armed members and belong especially to its Western, Eastern and Northeastern Fronts, units based in the Pacific jungle and in several provinces along Colombia's porous eastern border with Venezuela, according to the sources.""Illicit economies like drug trafficking and illegal mining and their millions in earnings will be the principal incentive for many members of the ELN to continue in their armed struggle and reject a peace accord,"" one of the sources said.A second said another factor was the ELN's autonomous and difficult to control structure. ""And many of its members are in Venezuela and they're not interested in entering a peace process,"" said the source.It is unclear exactly how many former FARC members have rejected that group's accord, but about 15% of its fighters never signed the deal and formed an initial dissident faction, according to estimates by analysts.And dozens, at least, of the 13,000 members who did back the accord later rejected it, founding a second major dissident group.Reaching accords with the FARC dissidents - who have remained active in the conflict - is also among Petro's peace goals.Both the ELN's head peace negotiator Pablo Beltran and its top armed commander Antonio Garcia have told Reuters in recent interviews that the group is united behind peace negotiations.The group did not respond to a request for comment on the 40% estimate, but the Western Front's spokesman, who uses the alias Yerson, told a local media outlet this week that his unit is ""not a loose wheel"" and that it follows the ELN's national command structure.The ELN talks, which restarted in November 2022, are the most advanced of Petro's peace efforts, which also include conversations with crime gangs like the Clan del Golfo.Petro's high peace commissioner Danilo Rueda told Reuters there is a risk some fighters will not lay down arms and that internal divisions over unit autonomy and other issues are worrying, but said talks so far have demonstrated ELN unity.""We don't deny the risks that could come from a dialogue that doesn't acknowledge that reality,"" Rueda said, but added that orders from national ELN leaders are respected by fighters.The talks' methodology includes efforts to guarantee communication not just with leaders but fighters too, he added.The ELN is different from the FARC and despite the power of regional commanders, is disciplined, said Ariel Avila, a security expert and senator for the Green Alliance.He said the 40% estimate would be a very high figure.""I don't think there will be large dissident groups,"" Avila said. ""There will be dissidents, there are in all conflicts, but it will be a normal average between 10% and 15%.""Provisions in an eventual accord barring extradition abroad and protecting economic programs meant to provide jobs for former rebels must be implemented to discourage dissidents, Avila added.",https://www.reuters.com/article/colombia-peace/exclusive-at-least-40-of-colombias-eln-rebels-seen-rejecting-peace-deal-security-sources-idUSKBN30S0TS,reuters,2023-09-22,"['exclusive', 'at', 'least', 'colombia', 'eln', 'rebel', 'see', 'reject', 'peace', 'deal', 'security', 'source', 'say', 'reuters', 'at', 'least', 'fighter', 'colombia', 'national', 'liberation', 'army', 'eln', 'rebel', 'could', 'reject', 'potential', 'peace', 'deal', 'negotiated', 'government', 'three', 'security', 'source', 'tell', 'reuters', 'cite', 'reluctance', 'surrender', 'profit', 'drug', 'smuggle', 'illegal', 'estimate', 'put', 'risk', 'ambitious', 'plan', 'country', 'first', 'leftist', 'leader', 'president', 'gustavo', 'petro', 'end', 'colombia', 'war', 'kill', 'people', 'accord', 'rebel', 'criminal', 'formation', 'dissident', 'group', 'eln', 'member', 'would', 'echo', 'see', 'peace', 'deal', 'revolutionary', 'armed', 'force', 'colombia', 'farc', 'guerrilla', 'group', 'hundred', 'holdouts', 'rejected', 'agreement', 'day', 'continue', 'illegal', 'activity', 'would', 'also', 'appear', 'undermine', 'repeat', 'reassurance', 'eln', 'leader', 'group', 'unite', 'behind', 'talk', 'the', 'group', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'atomized', 'command', 'structure', 'eln', 'long', 'concern', 'security', 'analyst', 'critic', 'talk', 'warn', 'group', 'radical', 'unit', 'unlikely', 'adhere', 'three', 'security', 'source', 'say', 'eln', 'total', 'member', 'see', 'likely', 'reject', 'number', 'among', 'group', 'arm', 'member', 'belong', 'especially', 'western', 'eastern', 'northeastern', 'front', 'unit', 'base', 'pacific', 'jungle', 'several', 'province', 'along', 'colombia', 'porous', 'eastern', 'border', 'venezuela', 'accord', 'source', 'illicit', 'economy', 'like', 'drug', 'traffic', 'illegal', 'mining', 'million', 'earnings', 'principal', 'incentive', 'many', 'member', 'eln', 'continue', 'arm', 'struggle', 'reject', 'peace', 'accord', 'one', 'source', 'second', 'say', 'another', 'factor', 'eln', 'autonomous', 'difficult', 'control', 'structure', 'and', 'many', 'member', 'venezuela', 'interested', 'enter', 'peace', 'process', 'say', 'unclear', 'exactly', 'many', 'former', 'farc', 'member', 'reject', 'group', 'accord', 'fighters', 'never', 'sign', 'deal', 'form', 'initial', 'dissident', 'faction', 'accord', 'estimate', 'dozen', 'least', 'member', 'back', 'accord', 'later', 'reject', 'found', 'second', 'major', 'dissident', 'accord', 'farc', 'dissident', 'remain', 'active', 'conflict', 'also', 'among', 'petro', 'peace', 'eln', 'head', 'peace', 'negotiator', 'pablo', 'beltran', 'top', 'arm', 'commander', 'antonio', 'garcia', 'tell', 'reuters', 'recent', 'interview', 'group', 'unite', 'behind', 'peace', 'group', 'respond', 'request', 'comment', 'estimate', 'western', 'front', 'spokesman', 'use', 'alias', 'yerson', 'tell', 'local', 'medium', 'outlet', 'week', 'unit', 'loose', 'wheel', 'follow', 'eln', 'national', 'command', 'eln', 'talk', 'restart', 'november', 'advance', 'petro', 'peace', 'effort', 'also', 'include', 'conversation', 'crime', 'gang', 'like', 'clan', 'del', 'high', 'peace', 'commissioner', 'danilo', 'rueda', 'tell', 'reuters', 'risk', 'fighter', 'lay', 'arm', 'internal', 'division', 'unit', 'autonomy', 'issue', 'worry', 'say', 'talk', 'far', 'demonstrate', 'eln', 'unity', 'we', 'deny', 'risk', 'could', 'come', 'dialogue', 'acknowledge', 'reality', 'rueda', 'say', 'added', 'order', 'national', 'eln', 'leader', 'respect', 'talk', 'methodology', 'include', 'effort', 'guarantee', 'communication', 'leader', 'fighter', 'eln', 'different', 'farc', 'despite', 'power', 'regional', 'commander', 'discipline', 'say', 'ariel', 'avila', 'security', 'expert', 'senator', 'green', 'say', 'estimate', 'would', 'high', 'figure', 'i', 'think', 'large', 'dissident', 'group', 'avila', 'say', 'there', 'dissident', 'conflict', 'normal', 'average', 'provision', 'eventual', 'accord', 'bar', 'extradition', 'abroad', 'protect', 'economic', 'program', 'mean', 'provide', 'job', 'former', 'rebel', 'must', 'implement', 'discourage', 'dissident', 'avila', 'add']"
54,"In Washington, Zelenskiy courts Congress, Biden on military aid | Reuters",2023-09-22 06:43:00-04:00,") - U.S. President Joe Biden assured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday that strong U.S. support for his war to repel Russian invaders will be maintained despite opposition from some Republican lawmakers to sending billions more in aid.Biden and Zelenskiy held a war council in the White House East Room as part of a blizzard of appearances the Ukraine leader made looking to bolster U.S. support for a war that began in February 2022 and has no end in sight.""Mr. President, we're with you, we're staying with you,"" Biden told Zelenskiy before reaching across the table and shaking his hand after two hours of talks.Zelenskiy thanked Biden for a new $325 million military aid package of weaponry and air defenses, saying ""it has exactly what our soldiers need now.""He said he and Biden agreed on specific steps to expand the export of grain from Ukraine in the face of a Russian blockade and tensions with neighbor Poland. He did not detail the steps.Biden's request for $24 billion in more Ukraine funding to help pay for Ukraine's defense and humanitarian aid through the end of the year is bottled up in a budget fight pushed by Republican hardliners in the House of Representatives.Asked how to overcome the opposition, Biden said the only way was approval by the U.S. Congress.“I’m counting on the good judgment of the United States Congress. There’s no alternative,"" he said.Comments from Republican Senator Rand Paul, a frequent critic of foreign aid, were emblematic of the opposition. He told Fox Business News that Ukraine is a ""corrupt regime"" and that the war has no end in sight.Biden said the first American Abrams tanks will be delivered to Ukraine next week.""Just as we're committed to helping Ukraine defend itself now, we're also committed to helping them recover and rebuild in the future, including supporting reforms that will combat corruption,"" Biden said.Biden said Washington would also send Ukraine a second Raytheon-built Hawk air defense battery and related equipment. A U.S. official said the equipment would arrive in Ukraine soon.After seeking international support at the United Nations on Wednesday, Zelenskiy came to Washington on a blitz across town that included meetings with military leaders at the Pentagon, a visit to the U.S. Capitol and an address in the evening at the National Archives museum.In announcing a new $325 million military aid package for Ukraine, Biden lauded the bravery of the Ukrainian people when he and Zelenskiy met earlier in the Oval Office.""Together with our partners and allies, the American people are determined to see to it to that (we do) all we can to ensure that the world stands with you,"" Biden said in comments at the start of their meeting.Zelenskiy said Ukraine greatly appreciates U.S. assistance ""to combat Russian terror"" and said he would discuss Ukraine's defense needs with Biden, with a special emphasis on air defense.""Today I'm in Washington to strengthen our ability to defend Ukrainian children, our families, our homes, freedom and democracy in the world,"" he added.While Biden and most congressional leaders still support aid to Ukraine, and Biden's Democrats control the Senate, Zelenskiy faced a tougher crowd than when he visited Washington nine months ago.Dressed in military green to reflect his status as a wartime leader, Zelenskiy briefed the full U.S. Senate in the Capitol's historic Old Senate Chamber, receiving several standing ovations, according to a post on the platform X by Senator Chris Murphy.Zelenskiy told senators that military aid was crucial to Ukraine's war effort, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in the Senate chamber after the briefing, which took place behind closed doors.""If we don't get the aid, we will lose the war,"" Schumer quoted Zelenskiy as saying.Zelenskiy later described his meetings with lawmakers as frank and constructive.Zelenskiy held discussions with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other senior Pentagon leaders. He visited the Pentagon's memorial of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks where he and his wife each placed a bouquet of sunflowers, irises and other flowers.The White House announced the U.S. will host a conference this fall for the U.S. defense industry, Ukrainian business leaders and officials from both governments to explore joint ventures and co-production, as Washington seeks to bolster Ukraine's long-term defense capabilities.In their meeting, Zelenskiy shared with Biden his plans to address corruption and Biden emphasized the importance of strong anti-corruption institutions in Ukraine, the White House said.In his speech at the National Archives, in front of a display case holding the U.S. Constitution, Zelenskiy thanked Americans for their support, saying ""there is not a soul in Ukraine that does not feel gratitude to you, America.""Zelenskiy and his wife handed out awards to doctors who treated Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, and to people who raised funds for medical equipment, ambulances and other vital supplies.As Ukraine's military counteroffensive grinds on and Congress stages a bitter debate over spending ahead of a possible government shutdown, a growing chorus of Republicans have questioned the billions of dollars Washington has sent Kyiv for military, economic and humanitarian needs.The U.S. has sent some $113 billion in security and humanitarian aid to help Zelenskiy's government since Russia invaded in February 2022.(This story has been corrected to say billion, not million, in paragraph

55,"Iran parades new 'longest-range' drone on Iraq war anniversary, state media report | Reuters",2023-09-22 08:25:00-04:00,") - Iran on Friday paraded its military hardware on the anniversary of its 1980s war with Iraq, including ""the longest-range drone in the world"" along with ballistic and hypersonic missiles, Iranian state media said.They said the drone ""was unveiled” in the parade, which was broadcast live, and that drones displayed in the event were named Mohajer, Shahed and Arash.The Islamic Republic said last month that it had built an advanced drone named Mohajer-10 with an enhanced flight range and duration as well as a larger payload.It has an operational range of 2,000 km (1,240 miles) and can fly for up to 24 hours, state media reported then, adding that its payload could reach 300 kg (661 pounds), double the capacity of the Mohajer-6 drone.The United States has accused Iran of providing Mohajer-6 drones, among other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to Russia for its war against Ukraine. On Tuesday, Washington expanded Iran-related sanctions, citing Tehran's ""continued, deliberate proliferation of UAVs"" enabling Russia, its proxies in the Middle East and other destabilising actors"".Iran denies providing drones to Russia for the conflict in Ukraine.“Our forces ensure security in the region and the Persian Gulf,” President Ebrahim Raisi said at Friday’s parade in the capital Tehran. “We can teach the people of the region that resistance is today’s way. What forces the enemy to retreat is not submission and wavering, but resistance.”A video released last month by Iranian media showed the Mohajer-6 among other military hardware, with a text reading ""prepare your shelters"" in both Persian and Hebrew, the latter an allusion to Iran's arch-regional enemy, Israel.The United States issued fresh Iran-related sanctions on Tuesday, targeting multiple people and entities in Iran, Russia, China and Turkey over Tehran's drone and military aircraft development.The Iran-Iraq war erupted on Sept. 22, 1980 when the forces of then-Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Iran. The conflict, which was economically devastating and left at least half a million dead, ended in stalemate in August 1988.",https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-military-parade/iran-parades-new-longest-range-drone-on-iraq-war-anniversary-state-media-idUSKBN30S0H6,reuters,2023-09-22,"['iran', 'parade', 'new', 'drone', 'iraq', 'war', 'anniversary', 'state', 'medium', 'report', 'reuters', 'iran', 'friday', 'parade', 'military', 'hardware', 'anniversary', 'war', 'iraq', 'include', 'drone', 'world', 'along', 'ballistic', 'hypersonic', 'missile', 'iranian', 'state', 'medium', 'say', 'drone', 'unveil', 'parade', 'broadcast', 'live', 'drone', 'display', 'event', 'name', 'mohajer', 'shahed', 'islamic', 'republic', 'say', 'last', 'month', 'build', 'advanced', 'drone', 'name', 'enhanced', 'flight', 'range', 'duration', 'well', 'large', 'operational', 'range', 'km', 'mile', 'fly', 'hour', 'state', 'medium', 'report', 'add', 'payload', 'could', 'reach', 'kg', 'pound', 'double', 'capacity', 'united', 'state', 'accuse', 'iran', 'provide', 'drone', 'among', 'unmanned', 'aerial', 'vehicle', 'uavs', 'russia', 'war', 'ukraine', 'on', 'tuesday', 'washington', 'expand', 'sanction', 'cite', 'tehran', 'continue', 'deliberate', 'proliferation', 'uavs', 'enable', 'russia', 'proxy', 'middle', 'east', 'destabilise', 'actor', 'deny', 'provide', 'drone', 'russia', 'conflict', 'our', 'force', 'ensure', 'security', 'region', 'persian', 'gulf', 'president', 'ebrahim', 'raisi', 'say', 'friday', 'parade', 'capital', 'tehran', 'we', 'teach', 'people', 'region', 'resistance', 'today', 'way', 'what', 'force', 'enemy', 'retreat', 'submission', 'waver', 'a', 'video', 'release', 'last', 'month', 'iranian', 'medium', 'show', 'among', 'military', 'hardware', 'text', 'read', 'prepare', 'shelter', 'persian', 'hebrew', 'latter', 'allusion', 'iran', 'enemy', 'united', 'state', 'issue', 'fresh', 'sanction', 'tuesday', 'target', 'multiple', 'people', 'entity', 'iran', 'russia', 'china', 'turkey', 'tehran', 'drone', 'military', 'aircraft', 'war', 'erupt', 'force', 'president', 'saddam', 'hussein', 'invade', 'iran', 'the', 'conflict', 'economically', 'devastate', 'leave', 'least', 'half', 'million', 'dead', 'end', 'stalemate', 'august']"
56,"Anti-affirmative action group, emboldened by US Supreme Court, targets scholarships | Reuters",2023-09-22 06:23:00-04:00,") - A non-profit group opposing race-based education policies has filed more than a dozen U.S. civil rights complaints this year against universities, challenging the legality of offering minority scholarships, summer study and residency programs to promote racial diversity.The challenges are part of a growing campaign against diversity initiatives after a U.S. Supreme Court landmark ruling in June outlawed use of race in college admissions, commonly known as affirmative action. Conservative activists say the decision should extend to all educational programs, and some groups have also challenged corporate diversity policies.The Equal Protection Project of the Legal Insurrection Foundation, headed by Cornell University clinical law professor William Jacobson, filed the complaints with the U.S. Department of Education's civil rights office.The latest complaint, filed last week, accused Western Kentucky University of violating civil rights law by offering two scholarships – one for undergraduate students and one for graduate students – available only to minority applicants. The university did not respond to a request for comment.Other targets include a minority scholarship at Kansas State University and a residency program for Black filmmakers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.In an interview, Jacobson said the education department has asked the group for more information but has not indicated whether it will launch formal investigations. A departmental spokesperson said the office for civil rights does not discuss details of its cases.Jacobson said any program contingent on race is unlawful.""The typical response is, well, what's wrong with wanting diversity?"" he said. ""There's nothing wrong with that. But you can't do it through racial discrimination, and the Supreme Court has been very clear about that.""Advocates say race-conscious programs are necessary to combat institutional and societal disadvantages facing minority students, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's decision. Black children are more likely to grow up in low-income households, with less access to high-quality child care and enrichment activities.Top schools have warned that eliminating race as an admissions factor will result in fewer minority students.""A student missing $1,000 or having a gap of $800 could mean the difference between being able to graduate or not,"" said Ameshia Cross, director of communications for the Education Trust, whose website says it works to ""dismantle the racial and economic barriers embedded in the American education system.""Cross, who also works as a Democratic strategist, said she would not have been able to attend Belmont University, a private school, without the help of an annual $5,000 minority scholarship.While the Supreme Court's ruling was limited to admissions, it prompted some schools to re-examine race-based programs.The University of Missouri system announced it would eliminate race as a factor in awarding scholarships. The state's Republican attorney general sent a letter instructing all colleges in Missouri, including private schools, to adopt race-blind standards for admissions, scholarships, employment and other programs.Other schools have vowed to pursue alternative avenues toward improving racial diversity, such as increasing recruiting from underprivileged schools.Evan Caminker, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said it was not yet clear whether the Supreme Court decision would extend beyond admissions to race-conscious programs. He noted that the court emphasized the ""zero-sum"" nature of admissions - every successful applicant takes away a spot from other potential students.By contrast, a school might award its scholarships in a race-neutral way, only to then decide which specific scholarships would be assigned to which students, he said.The Department of Education's civil rights office is likely to be a frequent battleground. In July, the office confirmed it had opened an investigation into whether Harvard discriminates against minorities by favoring ""legacy"" applicants with ties to donors or alumni, following a complaint filed by civil rights groups.On Tuesday, the organization that won the Supreme Court case, Students for Fair Admissions, filed a new lawsuit challenging affirmative action admission practices at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The Supreme Court had exempted military academies from its June decision, saying in a footnote that these schools might have ""distinct"" interests.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-race-education/anti-affirmative-action-group-emboldened-by-us-supreme-court-targets-scholarships-idUSKBN30S0ON,reuters,2023-09-22,"['action', 'group', 'embolden', 'u', 'supreme', 'court', 'target', 'scholarships', 'reuters', 'a', 'group', 'oppose', 'education', 'policy', 'file', 'dozen', 'civil', 'right', 'complaint', 'year', 'university', 'challenge', 'legality', 'offer', 'minority', 'scholarship', 'summer', 'study', 'residency', 'program', 'promote', 'racial', 'challenge', 'part', 'grow', 'campaign', 'diversity', 'initiatives', 'supreme', 'court', 'landmark', 'rule', 'june', 'outlaw', 'use', 'race', 'college', 'admission', 'commonly', 'know', 'affirmative', 'action', 'conservative', 'activist', 'say', 'decision', 'extend', 'educational', 'program', 'group', 'also', 'challenge', 'corporate', 'diversity', 'equal', 'protection', 'project', 'legal', 'insurrection', 'foundation', 'head', 'cornell', 'university', 'clinical', 'law', 'professor', 'william', 'jacobson', 'file', 'complaint', 'department', 'education', 'civil', 'right', 'late', 'complaint', 'file', 'last', 'week', 'accuse', 'western', 'kentucky', 'university', 'violate', 'civil', 'right', 'law', 'offering', 'two', 'scholarship', 'one', 'undergraduate', 'student', 'one', 'graduate', 'student', 'available', 'minority', 'applicants', 'the', 'university', 'respond', 'request', 'target', 'include', 'minority', 'scholarship', 'kansa', 'state', 'university', 'residency', 'program', 'black', 'filmmakers', 'university', 'interview', 'jacobson', 'say', 'education', 'department', 'ask', 'group', 'information', 'indicate', 'whether', 'launch', 'formal', 'investigation', 'a', 'departmental', 'spokesperson', 'say', 'office', 'civil', 'right', 'discus', 'detail', 'say', 'program', 'contingent', 'race', 'unlawful', 'the', 'typical', 'response', 'well', 'wrong', 'want', 'diversity', 'say', 'there', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'but', 'ca', 'racial', 'discrimination', 'supreme', 'court', 'clear', 'advocate', 'say', 'program', 'necessary', 'combat', 'institutional', 'societal', 'disadvantage', 'face', 'minority', 'student', 'particularly', 'light', 'supreme', 'court', 'decision', 'black', 'child', 'likely', 'grow', 'household', 'less', 'access', 'child', 'care', 'enrichment', 'school', 'warn', 'eliminate', 'race', 'admission', 'factor', 'result', 'few', 'minority', 'student', 'a', 'student', 'miss', 'gap', 'could', 'mean', 'difference', 'able', 'graduate', 'say', 'ameshia', 'cross', 'director', 'communication', 'education', 'trust', 'whose', 'website', 'say', 'work', 'dismantle', 'racial', 'economic', 'barrier', 'embed', 'american', 'education', 'system', 'cross', 'also', 'work', 'democratic', 'strategist', 'say', 'would', 'able', 'attend', 'belmont', 'university', 'private', 'school', 'without', 'help', 'annual', 'minority', 'supreme', 'court', 'ruling', 'limit', 'admission', 'prompt', 'school', 'university', 'missouri', 'system', 'announce', 'would', 'eliminate', 'race', 'factor', 'award', 'scholarship', 'the', 'state', 'republican', 'attorney', 'general', 'sent', 'letter', 'instruct', 'college', 'missouri', 'include', 'private', 'school', 'adopt', 'standard', 'admission', 'scholarships', 'employment', 'school', 'vow', 'pursue', 'alternative', 'avenue', 'toward', 'improve', 'racial', 'diversity', 'increase', 'recruit', 'underprivileged', 'caminker', 'law', 'professor', 'university', 'michigan', 'say', 'yet', 'clear', 'whether', 'supreme', 'court', 'decision', 'would', 'extend', 'beyond', 'admission', 'program', 'he', 'note', 'court', 'emphasized', 'nature', 'admission', 'every', 'successful', 'applicant', 'take', 'away', 'spot', 'potential', 'contrast', 'school', 'might', 'award', 'scholarships', 'way', 'decide', 'specific', 'scholarship', 'would', 'assign', 'student', 'department', 'education', 'civil', 'right', 'office', 'likely', 'frequent', 'battleground', 'in', 'july', 'office', 'confirm', 'open', 'investigation', 'whether', 'harvard', 'discriminate', 'minority', 'favor', 'legacy', 'applicant', 'tie', 'donor', 'alumnus', 'follow', 'complaint', 'file', 'civil', 'right', 'tuesday', 'organization', 'supreme', 'court', 'case', 'student', 'fair', 'admission', 'file', 'new', 'lawsuit', 'challenge', 'affirmative', 'action', 'admission', 'practice', 'military', 'academy', 'west', 'point', 'the', 'supreme', 'court', 'exempt', 'military', 'academy', 'june', 'decision', 'say', 'footnote', 'school', 'might', 'distinct', 'interest']"
57,Fed is cutting staff after more than a decade of payroll growth | Reuters,2023-09-22 06:13:00-04:00,") - The U.S. Federal Reserve system is cutting about 300 people from its payroll this year, a small but rare reduction in headcount across an organization that has grown steadily since 2010 as its reach in the economy and regulatory agenda have expanded.A Fed spokesperson said the cuts are focused on the staff of the U.S. central bank's 12 regional reserve banks and mainly hit information technology jobs, including some no longer needed because of the spread of cloud-based computer software, and positions connected to the Fed's various systems for processing payments, which are being consolidated.The spokesperson, who would not speak for direct attribution, said the staff cuts represented a combination of attrition, including retirements, and layoffs.According to annual reports and financial documents prepared by the Fed each year, the number of staff budgeted for the system, including its regional banks, the Washington-based Board of Governors, and three smaller units, is due to fall by more than 500 positions from 2022 to 2023, from 24,428 to 23,895.While small compared to the size of the Fed, it is the first time budgeted headcount has fallen since 2010.Since actual employment in 2022 fell below budget - a December Fed memo cites ""higher than-budgeted turnover and extended lags in filling open positions,"" notably in the area of bank supervision, as the reason - the number of positions being eliminated this year is somewhat smaller than the budgeted decline.The size of any drop in actual employment won't be known until early next year when the Fed closes its books on 2023 and releases its latest annual report.While the December memo from the Board of Governors division that oversees the regional reserve banks does not explicitly call for staff cuts, it highlights the need to stick with internal budgeting protocols, ""with the most important focal points being alignment with long-term strategy and stewardship of public funds.""The staff reductions are happening at a sensitive time for the Fed. It has booked $100 billion in losses in recent months on operations that currently involve paying more in interest to banks on reserve deposits at the Fed than the central bank earns from its roughly $7.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and mortgage-backed securities.Unlike federal agencies that spend tax dollars allocated by Congress, the Fed is self-funding. Its earnings from its asset holdings and fees charged to banks for a range of services are used to pay the roughly $6.3 billion in annual expenses of a system that employs nearly 24,000 people in Washington and other cities across the country.In most years the Fed generates a profit that is turned over to the U.S. Treasury. But since the central bank began to increase interest rates to control a surge in inflation, it has been spending more than it earns each year, and in effect gives the Treasury an IOU to be paid later.While the staff cuts are not directly tied to the Fed's losses, the central bank's operations have been under scrutiny among Republicans in Congress who have expressed concern about how deeply the Fed was delving into issues, like climate change and the economics of inequality, that seemed to them to be beyond its monetary policy and bank supervisory missions.The number of system-wide jobs at the Fed had been falling earlier this century, from just shy of 24,000 as of 2003 to 19,735 as of 2010, as the end of the paper check era allowed the Fed to trim the legions of workers it took to clear and process those documents.With Congress layering on new responsibilities in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession, the push to modernize and expand the Fed's role in processing payments, and new financial stability and other initiatives, staffing since then has grown every year, according to annual Fed budget and financial reports filed with Congress.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fed-staffing/fed-is-cutting-staff-after-more-than-a-decade-of-payroll-growth-idUSKBN30S0PP,reuters,2023-09-22,"['fed', 'cut', 'staff', 'decade', 'payroll', 'growth', 'reuters', 'the', 'federal', 'reserve', 'system', 'cut', 'people', 'payroll', 'year', 'small', 'rare', 'reduction', 'headcount', 'across', 'organization', 'grow', 'steadily', 'since', 'reach', 'economy', 'regulatory', 'agenda', 'fed', 'spokesperson', 'say', 'cut', 'focused', 'staff', 'central', 'bank', 'regional', 'reserve', 'bank', 'mainly', 'hit', 'information', 'technology', 'job', 'include', 'longer', 'need', 'spread', 'computer', 'software', 'position', 'connect', 'fed', 'various', 'system', 'process', 'payment', 'spokesperson', 'would', 'speak', 'direct', 'attribution', 'say', 'staff', 'cut', 'represent', 'combination', 'attrition', 'include', 'retirement', 'annual', 'report', 'financial', 'document', 'prepare', 'fed', 'year', 'number', 'staff', 'budget', 'system', 'include', 'regional', 'bank', 'board', 'governor', 'three', 'small', 'unit', 'due', 'fall', 'position', 'small', 'compare', 'size', 'fed', 'first', 'time', 'budget', 'headcount', 'fall', 'since', 'actual', 'employment', 'fell', 'budget', 'december', 'fed', 'memo', 'cite', 'high', 'turnover', 'extend', 'lags', 'fill', 'open', 'position', 'notably', 'area', 'bank', 'supervision', 'reason', 'number', 'position', 'eliminate', 'year', 'somewhat', 'small', 'budgeted', 'size', 'drop', 'actual', 'employment', 'wo', 'know', 'early', 'next', 'year', 'fed', 'close', 'book', 'release', 'late', 'annual', 'december', 'memo', 'board', 'governor', 'division', 'oversee', 'regional', 'reserve', 'bank', 'explicitly', 'call', 'staff', 'cut', 'highlight', 'need', 'stick', 'internal', 'budgeting', 'protocol', 'important', 'focal', 'point', 'alignment', 'strategy', 'stewardship', 'public', 'fund', 'the', 'staff', 'reduction', 'happen', 'sensitive', 'time', 'fed', 'it', 'book', 'billion', 'loss', 'recent', 'month', 'operation', 'currently', 'involve', 'pay', 'interest', 'bank', 'reserve', 'deposit', 'fed', 'central', 'bank', 'earn', 'roughly', 'trillion', 'portfolio', 'bond', 'federal', 'agency', 'spend', 'tax', 'dollar', 'allocate', 'congress', 'fed', 'it', 'earnings', 'asset', 'holding', 'fee', 'charge', 'bank', 'range', 'service', 'use', 'pay', 'roughly', 'billion', 'annual', 'expense', 'system', 'employ', 'nearly', 'people', 'washington', 'city', 'across', 'year', 'fed', 'generate', 'profit', 'turn', 'treasury', 'but', 'since', 'central', 'bank', 'begin', 'increase', 'interest', 'rate', 'control', 'surge', 'inflation', 'spending', 'earn', 'year', 'effect', 'give', 'treasury', 'iou', 'pay', 'staff', 'cut', 'directly', 'tie', 'fed', 'loss', 'central', 'bank', 'operation', 'scrutiny', 'among', 'republican', 'congress', 'express', 'concern', 'deeply', 'fed', 'delve', 'issue', 'like', 'climate', 'change', 'economics', 'inequality', 'seem', 'beyond', 'monetary', 'policy', 'bank', 'supervisory', 'number', 'job', 'fed', 'fall', 'earlier', 'century', 'shy', 'end', 'paper', 'check', 'era', 'allow', 'fed', 'trim', 'legion', 'worker', 'take', 'clear', 'process', 'congress', 'layer', 'new', 'responsibility', 'wake', 'financial', 'crisis', 'recession', 'push', 'modernize', 'expand', 'fed', 'role', 'processing', 'payment', 'new', 'financial', 'stability', 'initiatives', 'staff', 'since', 'grow', 'every', 'year', 'accord', 'annual', 'fed', 'budget', 'financial', 'report', 'file', 'congress']"

60,Alabama seeks to execute prisoner using nitrogen gas asphyxiation | Reuters,2023-09-22 07:19:00-04:00,") - The Supreme Court of Alabama is weighing whether to allow the state to become the first to execute a prisoner with a novel method: asphyxiation using nitrogen gas.Last month, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall asked the court to allow the state to proceed with gassing Kenneth Smith, who was convicted of murder in 1996, using a face mask connected to a cylinder of nitrogen intended to deprive him of oxygen.Smith's lawyers have said the untested protocol may violate the U.S. Constitution's ban on ""cruel and unusual punishments."" They are due to file their opposition to the attorney general's death warrant application with the court on Friday.Death penalty experts also say the state has not provided enough information about how it will mitigate the danger to execution officials and others of using an invisible, odorless gas inside the death chamber.Smith, 58, is one of only two people alive in the U.S. to have survived an execution attempt after Alabama botched his previously scheduled execution by lethal injection last November when multiple attempts to insert an intravenous line into a vein failed.Most executions in the U.S. use lethal injections of a barbiturate, but the decades-old method has become more challenging in recent years.Some states have struggled to obtain the needed drugs as pharmaceutical companies refuse to sell them to prison systems. Autopsies have found the lungs of people executed by lethal injection filled with frothed bloody fluids, which opponents of the punishment say shows they suffered the sensation of drowning before they died.In seeking the death warrant, the attorney general's office released a heavily redacted version of the Alabama Department of Corrections' new gassing protocol, which it refers to as ""nitrogen hypoxia.""In the gas chambers used in earlier executions by U.S. states and in Nazi concentration camps, poisonous gases such as hydrogen cyanide were used to kill. Nitrogen, however, is not poisonous, making up about 78% of breathable air. In Alabama's proposed method, which lawmakers approved in 2018, it is intended to displace the oxygen being inhaled by the condemned person.Oklahoma and Mississippi have also approved nitrogen asphyxiation executions, but are yet to try the method.The unredacted portions of Alabama's protocol indicate Smith would be placed on a gurney and a mask would be strapped on his face. Many details about the new apparatus remain unclear, but the mask has both an inflow tube attached to it and an outflow mechanism for exhaled breaths.Dr. Joel Zivot, an anesthesiologist at the Emory School of Medicine who has been an expert witness in challenges to execution protocols, said it is difficult enough for doctors to maintain an airtight seal when applying a mask to an unconscious patient, and it is unclear how Alabama is addressing this issue in using a mask on a conscious, possibly uncooperative prisoner.""It's clear to me that they don't know what they're doing,"" Zivot said. ""If there's any air that gets in underneath mask then they're not going to die."" Someone who is temporarily starved of oxygen but does not die risks severe injury to the brain and other organs.Officials at the attorney general's office and the corrections department did not respond to queries.The published protocol does not say how Alabama will prevent pressurized nitrogen gas, which will run through the mask for at least 15 minutes, from leaking into the execution chamber and surrounding rooms, endangering others present.The state has said it will have oxygen-level meters in the execution chamber that will sound an alarm if levels fall too low.It will also require the condemned person's spiritual adviser to sign a form acknowledging the risk of ""inert-gas asphyxiation"" and agreeing to remain at least three feet (0.91 m) away from the mask and the outflow.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-executions/alabama-seeks-to-execute-prisoner-using-nitrogen-gas-asphyxiation-idUSKBN30S0TM,reuters,2023-09-22,"['alabama', 'seek', 'execute', 'prisoner', 'use', 'nitrogen', 'gas', 'asphyxiation', 'reuters', 'the', 'supreme', 'court', 'alabama', 'weigh', 'whether', 'allow', 'state', 'become', 'first', 'execute', 'prisoner', 'novel', 'method', 'asphyxiation', 'use', 'nitrogen', 'month', 'alabama', 'attorney', 'general', 'steve', 'marshall', 'ask', 'court', 'allow', 'state', 'proceed', 'gas', 'kenneth', 'smith', 'convict', 'murder', 'use', 'face', 'mask', 'connect', 'cylinder', 'nitrogen', 'intend', 'deprive', 'lawyer', 'say', 'untested', 'protocol', 'may', 'violate', 'constitution', 'ban', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'punishment', 'they', 'due', 'file', 'opposition', 'attorney', 'general', 'death', 'warrant', 'application', 'court', 'penalty', 'expert', 'also', 'say', 'state', 'provide', 'enough', 'information', 'mitigate', 'danger', 'execution', 'official', 'others', 'use', 'invisible', 'odorless', 'gas', 'inside', 'death', 'one', 'two', 'people', 'alive', 'survive', 'execution', 'attempt', 'alabama', 'botch', 'previously', 'schedule', 'execution', 'lethal', 'injection', 'last', 'november', 'multiple', 'attempt', 'insert', 'intravenous', 'line', 'vein', 'execution', 'use', 'lethal', 'injection', 'barbiturate', 'method', 'become', 'challenge', 'recent', 'state', 'struggle', 'obtain', 'needed', 'drug', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'refuse', 'sell', 'prison', 'system', 'autopsy', 'find', 'lung', 'people', 'execute', 'lethal', 'injection', 'fill', 'froth', 'bloody', 'fluids', 'opponent', 'punishment', 'say', 'show', 'suffer', 'sensation', 'drown', 'seek', 'death', 'warrant', 'attorney', 'general', 'office', 'release', 'heavily', 'redact', 'version', 'alabama', 'department', 'correction', 'new', 'gas', 'protocol', 'refers', 'nitrogen', 'hypoxia', 'in', 'gas', 'chamber', 'use', 'early', 'execution', 'state', 'nazi', 'concentration', 'camp', 'poisonous', 'gas', 'hydrogen', 'cyanide', 'use', 'kill', 'nitrogen', 'however', 'poisonous', 'make', 'breathable', 'air', 'in', 'alabama', 'propose', 'method', 'lawmaker', 'approve', 'intended', 'displace', 'oxygen', 'inhale', 'condemn', 'mississippi', 'also', 'approve', 'nitrogen', 'asphyxiation', 'execution', 'yet', 'try', 'unredacted', 'portion', 'alabama', 'protocol', 'indicate', 'smith', 'would', 'place', 'gurney', 'mask', 'would', 'strap', 'face', 'many', 'detail', 'new', 'apparatus', 'remain', 'unclear', 'mask', 'inflow', 'tube', 'attach', 'outflow', 'mechanism', 'exhale', 'joel', 'zivot', 'anesthesiologist', 'emory', 'school', 'medicine', 'expert', 'witness', 'challenge', 'execution', 'protocol', 'say', 'difficult', 'enough', 'doctor', 'maintain', 'airtight', 'seal', 'apply', 'mask', 'unconscious', 'patient', 'unclear', 'alabama', 'address', 'issue', 'use', 'mask', 'conscious', 'possibly', 'uncooperative', 'prisoner', 'it', 'clear', 'know', 'zivot', 'say', 'if', 'air', 'get', 'underneath', 'mask', 'go', 'die', 'someone', 'temporarily', 'starve', 'oxygen', 'die', 'risk', 'severe', 'injury', 'brain', 'attorney', 'general', 'office', 'correction', 'department', 'respond', 'publish', 'protocol', 'say', 'alabama', 'prevent', 'pressurize', 'nitrogen', 'gas', 'run', 'mask', 'least', 'minute', 'leak', 'execution', 'chamber', 'surround', 'room', 'endanger', 'others', 'state', 'say', 'meter', 'execution', 'chamber', 'sound', 'alarm', 'level', 'fall', 'also', 'require', 'condemned', 'person', 'spiritual', 'adviser', 'sign', 'form', 'acknowledge', 'risk', 'asphyxiation', 'agree', 'remain', 'least', 'three', 'foot', 'away', 'mask', 'outflow']"
61,"Trump, New York attorney general to argue over scope of looming fraud trial | Reuters",2023-09-22 06:20:00-04:00,") - Donald Trump's lawyers on Friday will try to persuade a New York judge to throw out, just 10 days before a scheduled trial, most or all of state Attorney General Letitia James's lawsuit accusing the former U.S. president of ""staggering"" fraud.Lawyers for James, in contrast, will ask the same Manhattan judge to find Trump and other defendants, including his adult sons and his Trump Organization family business, liable for fraud even before a jury starts hearing evidence.The looming trial comes as Trump enjoys a dominating lead in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing a slew of litigation including four criminal indictments where he has pleaded not guilty.Justice Arthur Engoron is reviewing James' claims that Trump repeatedly lied in financial statements to obtain better terms on loans and insurance.James has accused Trump of overstating the values of more than 20 properties from 2011 to 2021, including his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and Trump Tower penthouse in Manhattan, and inflating his own fortune by as much as $3.6 billion.""Based on the undisputed evidence, no trial is required for the court to determine that defendants presented grossly and materially inflated asset values,"" and used them to defraud banks and insurers, James has said.Trump has called the lawsuit a ""witch hunt.""His lawyers have argued that James has no authority to sue over private transactions they say were not fraudulent, and that most of her claims fall outside statutes of limitations.They cited a June decision by a state appeals court dismissing claims against Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, and various other claims predating July 2014 or February 2016.The court left it to Engoron to determine which parts could proceed.Last week, Trump accused James of ignoring the decision and Engoron of refusing to implement it, and said the trial should be delayed.That prompted an appeals court judge on Sept. 14 to temporarily stay the trial. A five-judge panel is expected to decide next week whether the trial should proceed.Engoron has chosen not to appear before the panel, and referred it to his prior orders.On Thursday, James called Trump's request for a delay a ""brazen and meritless"" attempt to undermine Engoron's authority.She said even a brief delay ""would likely wreak havoc"" on the trial and other trials that Trump faces.James' lawsuit seeks to bar Trump and his adult sons Donald Jr. And Eric from running businesses in New York. It also seeks at least $250 million of penalties.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-new-york-lawsuit/trump-ny-attorney-general-to-argue-over-scope-of-looming-fraud-trial-idUSKBN30S0PX,reuters,2023-09-22,"['trump', 'new', 'york', 'attorney', 'general', 'argue', 'scope', 'loom', 'fraud', 'trial', 'reuters', 'donald', 'trump', 'lawyer', 'friday', 'try', 'persuade', 'new', 'york', 'judge', 'throw', 'day', 'schedule', 'trial', 'state', 'attorney', 'general', 'letitia', 'james', 'lawsuit', 'accuse', 'former', 'president', 'stagger', 'james', 'contrast', 'ask', 'manhattan', 'judge', 'find', 'trump', 'defendant', 'include', 'adult', 'son', 'trump', 'organization', 'family', 'business', 'liable', 'fraud', 'even', 'jury', 'start', 'hear', 'loom', 'trial', 'come', 'trump', 'enjoy', 'dominate', 'lead', 'race', 'republican', 'presidential', 'nomination', 'despite', 'face', 'slew', 'litigation', 'include', 'four', 'criminal', 'indictment', 'plead', 'arthur', 'engoron', 'review', 'james', 'claim', 'trump', 'repeatedly', 'lie', 'financial', 'statement', 'obtain', 'good', 'term', 'loan', 'accuse', 'trump', 'overstate', 'value', 'property', 'include', 'club', 'florida', 'trump', 'tower', 'penthouse', 'manhattan', 'inflating', 'fortune', 'much', 'billion', 'base', 'undisputed', 'evidence', 'trial', 'require', 'court', 'determine', 'defendant', 'present', 'grossly', 'materially', 'inflated', 'asset', 'value', 'use', 'defraud', 'bank', 'insurer', 'james', 'call', 'lawsuit', 'witch', 'hunt', 'his', 'lawyer', 'argue', 'james', 'authority', 'sue', 'private', 'transaction', 'say', 'fraudulent', 'claim', 'fall', 'outside', 'statute', 'cite', 'june', 'decision', 'state', 'appeal', 'court', 'dismiss', 'claim', 'trump', 'daughter', 'ivanka', 'trump', 'various', 'claim', 'predate', 'july', 'february', 'court', 'leave', 'engoron', 'determine', 'part', 'could', 'week', 'trump', 'accuse', 'james', 'ignore', 'decision', 'engoron', 'refusing', 'implement', 'say', 'trial', 'prompt', 'appeal', 'court', 'judge', 'temporarily', 'stay', 'trial', 'a', 'panel', 'expect', 'decide', 'next', 'week', 'whether', 'trial', 'choose', 'appear', 'panel', 'refer', 'prior', 'thursday', 'james', 'call', 'trump', 'request', 'delay', 'brazen', 'meritless', 'attempt', 'undermine', 'engoron', 'say', 'even', 'brief', 'delay', 'would', 'likely', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'trial', 'trial', 'trump', 'lawsuit', 'seek', 'bar', 'trump', 'adult', 'son', 'donald', 'and', 'eric', 'run', 'business', 'new', 'york', 'it', 'also', 'seek', 'least', 'million', 'penalty']"
62,"Stocks stall, yields climb on ""higher for longer"" rate worries | Reuters",2023-09-22 08:13:00-04:00,") - Global shares stalled on Friday as U.S. yields climbed multi-year highs and the prospect of recession in Europe increased, compounding growing worries that U.S. interest rates will stay higher for longer.U.S. stock futures , , were slightly firmer ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street, signalling a pause after sharp losses on Thursday amid uncertainty over interest rates going into 2024.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are on track for their worst week since mid-March, while the dollar , up 0.17%, was headed for its 10th consecutive weekly increase, lifted by a fall in the euro on grim euro-zone economic data.Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit a 16-year high of 4.508%, later trading at 4.48%, while 30-year yields hit their highest in a dozen years. They were trading at 4.5721%, up slightly on the day.A re-assessment of the Fed's higher-for-longer policy was driving the rise in yields, creating headwinds for risk assets such as equities, credit and emerging markets, but supporting the dollar, ING bank said.The yen traded at 148.255 to the dollar, after falling sharply earlier in the day following the Bank of Japan's decision to hold interest rates in negative territory, suggesting it was in no rush to phase out its massive stimulus programme.Firmer oil prices , were trading above $90 a barrel, though on track for a small weekly drop after gaining more than 10% in the previous three weeks amid concerns about tight global supply.The mounting risk of a U.S. government shutdown in just 10 days was also being watched by markets.MSCI's index of global equities (.MIWD00000PUS) was flat, though still down about 2.6% for the week so far.""The massive week for central banks has really been all about the Fed. That is the focus of the market and that's what's driving the dollar right now,"" said Eren Osman, managing director of wealth management at Arbuthnot Latham.The Fed revised downwards its unemployment rate forecast for next year, and if the U.S. economic data continued to improve, it would put ""upside risk"" on interest rates, making the need for a soft landing all the greater, Osman added.In sharp contrast with the U.S. economy, the euro zone economy will likely contract in the third quarter and won't return to growth anytime soon, HCOB's flash purchasing managers' index showed, hitting the euro and yields.The counterpart data for U.S. manufacturing and services data is due shortly after the opening bell on Wall Street.The pan-European STOXX 600 (.STOXX) share index was slightly weaker.Speeches from Fed officials Mary Daly, Neel Kashkari, Susan Collins and Lisa Cook are due later.MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) touched a 10-month low before bouncing to trade up 0.9% on vows in China to support private business. It is down 2.8% this week.The yen eased on news from the BoJ, with traders extra wary of intervention after the BOJ noted it was watching the impact of foreign exchange moves on Japan's economy.Japan's Nikkei (.N225) pared losses of as deep as 1% to trade 0.5% lower.Ten-year Japanese government bond futures rallied though cash yields were little changed and near decade highs at 0.745%.Investors were still digesting a slew of policy decisions from major central banks during the week.Fed members had lifted their median projection for the funds rate in 2024 by 50 basis points (bps) to 5.1% and traders shaved about 15 bps from implied futures pricing, which has rates at 4.7% at the end of next year.Central banks in Sweden and Norway announced 25 bp hikes with the prospect of more to come.Yet the Bank of England, in a split decision, left rates on hold for the first time in nearly two years, sending sterling to a six-month low, while the Swiss franc fell sharply after a surprise hold on rates from the Swiss National Bank.""It's a lot of mixed messages and stories, and often you get those around turning points,"" said Craig Ebert, senior economist at BNZ in Wellington.In emerging markets, Indian bonds and the rupee rallied after JPMorgan said it would add Indian debt to its widely tracked emerging markets index, setting the stage for billions of dollars in foreign inflows.Gold firmed 0.3% to $1,925 an ounce despite pressure from the stronger dollar and bond

He previously pleaded not guilty to those charges.A court docket entry showed that McGonigal intends to change his plea on Friday. It did not specify what charges he would be pleading guilty to.McGonigal’s lawyer and a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington declined to comment ahead of the hearing.U.S. prosecutors say the former Albanian intelligence officer had business interests in Europe and was a source for an FBI investigation involving foreign lobbying that McGonigal supervised.The most serious charges against McGonigal carry a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, but it’s likely prosecutors will seek a more lenient sentence as part of a plea agreement.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-russia-fbi/ex-fbi-agent-tied-to-russian-oligarch-to-plead-guilty-to-lying-about-payment-idUSKBN30S0OD,reuters,2023-09-22,"['agent', 'tie', 'russian', 'oligarch', 'plead', 'guilty', 'lie', 'payment', 'reuters', 'a', 'former', 'senior', 'fbi', 'agent', 'expect', 'plead', 'guilty', 'friday', 'charge', 'conceal', 'cash', 'payment', 'former', 'albanian', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'become', 'source', 'fbi', 'investigation', 'court', 'record', 'mcgonigal', 'lead', 'fbi', 'counterintelligence', 'division', 'new', 'york', 'retiring', 'schedule', 'appear', 'plea', 'hear', 'washington', 'federal', 'court', 'gmt', 'plead', 'guilty', 'conspiracy', 'charge', 'federal', 'court', 'manhattan', 'last', 'month', 'separate', 'case', 'relate', 'work', 'russian', 'oligarch', 'oleg', 'deripaska', 'deripaska', 'face', 'indictment', 'washington', 'charge', 'fail', 'report', 'cash', 'payment', 'trip', 'take', 'former', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'europe', 'he', 'previously', 'plead', 'guilty', 'court', 'docket', 'entry', 'show', 'mcgonigal', 'intend', 'change', 'plea', 'friday', 'it', 'specify', 'charge', 'would', 'plead', 'guilty', 'lawyer', 'spokesperson', 'attorney', 'office', 'washington', 'decline', 'comment', 'ahead', 'prosecutor', 'say', 'former', 'albanian', 'intelligence', 'officer', 'business', 'interest', 'europe', 'source', 'fbi', 'investigation', 'involve', 'foreign', 'lobbying', 'mcgonigal', 'serious', 'charge', 'mcgonigal', 'carry', 'maximum', 'prison', 'sentence', 'year', 'likely', 'prosecutor', 'seek', 'lenient', 'sentence', 'part', 'plea', 'agreement']"

65,Ukrainian troops vow to take back Bakhmut but say it won't be easy | Reuters,2023-09-22 08:42:00-04:00,") - Ukrainian soldiers are vowing to take back the shattered city of Bakhmut but face a long, hard slog after encountering fierce Russian resistance while retaking two villages last week on strategic high ground nearby.Bakhmut, captured by Russian forces in May, is Moscow's only big prize in more than a year of the war's bloodiest fighting, described by both sides as a meat grinder. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said this week that Kyiv would retake the city following the capture last week of Andriivka and Klishchiivka to the south.Viktor, a 23-year-old machine gunner and sharpshooter in the Third Separate Assault Brigade that has led the Ukrainian counter-offensive on Bakhmut's southern outskirts, had no doubt that the ruined city would be recaptured.But it won't be easy because Russia will still fight hard for it, demonstrated by the ferocity of the combat his unit had just endured in the outlying villages.""As for Bakhmut: we will take it,"" he said. ""It will be difficult. One shouldn't think that the counter-offensive and taking Bakhmut is easy: (that) we just flank them, close reinforcements routes and it is done. No, it is very difficult work. And it won't happen in a day or two or in a week.""Kyiv says the ruins of Bakhmut have only limited strategic value on their own, but that it still views the battle as pivotal because Russia has concentrated so many of its best troops there. Moscow says holding Bakhmut is key to capturing remaining territory in eastern provinces it claims to have annexed.Ukrainian soldiers who spoke to Reuters at a location about 20 km (12 miles) from Andriivka described a bloody slog, costing lives for every metre, before they ultimately vanquished the village's Russian defenders.""There was a line of woods we had attacked twice before,"" said Viktor, who gave no surname. ""When we actually entered it, we had to go a further three kilometres with the enemy constantly shooting. There were drones and explosions causing a lot of damage to our 'brothers'.""""People should understand that along every metre in that line of woods, boys are dying, many are injured,"" he said,His unit managed to advance through the woods, he said, but postponed its main assault until morning because it was dark.""Our comrades from another unit came from one side. We came from the other. They (the Russians) understood there was nowhere to go so they came to terms with it,"" he said.A soldier called Ilia, also 23, said there was simply no time to be afraid during the assault on Andriivka.""We were taking prisoners. They came out and our guys tied them up and I had control of the situation,"" he said.""I had to search the house with my comrade to make sure everything was 'clean' and at that moment a mortar round flew by very close, into one of the prisoners. I had a concussion. It was fine afterwards. Everyone who was there had a concussion.""",https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-military/ukrainian-troops-vow-to-take-back-bakhmut-but-say-it-wont-be-easy-idUSKBN30S10Q,reuters,2023-09-22,"['ukrainian', 'troop', 'vow', 'take', 'back', 'bakhmut', 'say', 'wo', 'easy', 'reuters', 'ukrainian', 'soldier', 'vow', 'take', 'back', 'shattered', 'city', 'bakhmut', 'face', 'long', 'hard', 'slog', 'encounter', 'fierce', 'russian', 'resistance', 'retake', 'two', 'village', 'last', 'week', 'strategic', 'high', 'ground', 'capture', 'russian', 'force', 'may', 'moscow', 'big', 'prize', 'year', 'war', 'bloodiest', 'fight', 'describe', 'side', 'meat', 'grinder', 'president', 'volodymyr', 'zelenskiy', 'say', 'week', 'kyiv', 'would', 'retake', 'city', 'follow', 'capture', 'last', 'week', 'andriivka', 'klishchiivka', 'machine', 'gunner', 'sharpshooter', 'third', 'separate', 'assault', 'brigade', 'lead', 'ukrainian', 'bakhmut', 'southern', 'outskirt', 'doubt', 'ruin', 'city', 'would', 'wo', 'easy', 'russia', 'still', 'fight', 'hard', 'demonstrate', 'ferocity', 'combat', 'unit', 'endure', 'outlying', 'village', 'a', 'bakhmut', 'take', 'say', 'it', 'difficult', 'one', 'think', 'take', 'bakhmut', 'easy', 'flank', 'close', 'reinforcement', 'rout', 'do', 'no', 'difficult', 'work', 'and', 'wo', 'happen', 'day', 'two', 'week', 'kyiv', 'say', 'ruin', 'bakhmut', 'limit', 'strategic', 'value', 'still', 'view', 'battle', 'pivotal', 'russia', 'concentrate', 'many', 'best', 'troop', 'moscow', 'say', 'hold', 'bakhmut', 'key', 'capture', 'remain', 'territory', 'eastern', 'province', 'claim', 'soldier', 'speak', 'reuters', 'location', 'km', 'mile', 'andriivka', 'describe', 'bloody', 'slog', 'cost', 'life', 'every', 'metre', 'ultimately', 'vanquished', 'village', 'russian', 'defender', 'there', 'line', 'wood', 'attack', 'twice', 'say', 'viktor', 'give', 'surname', 'when', 'actually', 'enter', 'go', 'three', 'kilometre', 'enemy', 'constantly', 'shoot', 'there', 'drone', 'explosion', 'cause', 'lot', 'damage', 'people', 'understand', 'along', 'every', 'metre', 'line', 'wood', 'boys', 'die', 'many', 'injure', 'say', 'his', 'unit', 'manage', 'advance', 'wood', 'say', 'postpone', 'main', 'assault', 'morning', 'dark', 'our', 'comrade', 'another', 'unit', 'come', 'one', 'side', 'we', 'come', 'they', 'russian', 'understood', 'nowhere', 'go', 'come', 'term', 'soldier', 'call', 'ilium', 'also', 'say', 'simply', 'time', 'afraid', 'assault', 'andriivka', 'we', 'take', 'prisoner', 'they', 'come', 'guy', 'tie', 'i', 'control', 'situation', 'say', 'i', 'search', 'house', 'comrade', 'make', 'sure', 'everything', 'moment', 'mortar', 'round', 'fly', 'close', 'one', 'prisoner', 'i', 'concussion', 'it', 'fine', 'afterwards', 'everyone', 'concussion']"

67,Analysis: DeSantis embraces risky abortion stance to draw contrast with Trump | Reuters,2023-09-22 06:16:00-04:00,") - As Ron DeSantis’ path to the Republican presidential nomination appears to be narrowing, the Florida governor has decided to go all-in on perhaps his most divisive and potentially toxic policy stance: support of a six-week abortion ban.A hardline position on abortion is fraught with political risk. Polls show that a majority of Americans favor making the procedure available early in the pregnancy, and some major donors are worried that DeSantis' viewpoint will sink his chances with moderate voters next year.But it appears DeSantis sees the issue as perhaps his best hope for scoring an upset victory in Iowa, which holds the first nominating contest of the 2024 race in January. The DeSantis campaign believes a win in Iowa might push other candidates from the field, leaving him as voters' primary alternative to former President Donald Trump, the current favorite.In recent days, DeSantis’ campaign has highlighted the six-week abortion bans passed this year in Florida and Iowa, while attempting to draw a contrast with Trump, who called DeSantis' decision to sign such a restrictive measure ""a terrible thing and a terrible mistake"" in an interview with NBC News.Trump also has been warning abortion opponents in the Republican Party that pushing the issue too far would have political consequences next year and suggested as president he would try to find some common ground with the abortion-rights movement.His comments outraged some evangelical leaders and handed DeSantis an opening he and his campaign quickly moved to exploit, as they argued Trump could not be trusted to stay the conservative course on the issue.“If (Trump's) going into this saying he’s going to make the Democrats happy with respect to right-to-life, I think all pro-lifers should know that he’s preparing to sell you out,"" DeSantis said in a radio interview in Iowa this week.The DeSantis War Room account on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, replayed the NBC Trump interview and featured Iowa pastors criticizing Trump.Never Back Down, a super PAC backing DeSantis, bought a video ad on Facebook citing Trump’s “betrayal” of the anti-abortion movement targeted at regions in Iowa that Trump visited this week.The new push on abortion comes as DeSantis lags behind Trump in the race to take on Democratic President Joe Biden in November 2024, with the most recent Reuters/Ipsos national poll showing DeSantis trailing by 37 percentage points.A DeSantis campaign adviser, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss strategy, said the governor was intent on replicating the tactics used by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz when he won Iowa over Trump in 2016, particularly by concentrating on rural counties with evangelical voters.Evangelicals are a potent political force in the state. DeSantis' campaign last week announced a ""Faith and Family"" coalition backed by 70 Iowa pastors and faith leaders.David Kochel, a veteran Republican operative in Iowa, said the abortion issue may cut against Republicans in a presidential election, but ""as a primary issue, it is pretty salient.""“DeSantis is smart to lean in on it,” said Kochel, as he noted Trump appears to be “changing his messaging for a general-election audience.”Trump has argued his anti-abortion bona fides are unassailable. In Iowa on Wednesday, he claimed credit for nominating three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, the seminal decision that granted constitutional protection to abortion.His campaign did not respond to questions about whether the ex-president was creating an opening for DeSantis with evangelicals.DeSantis signed the Florida bill in April with little fanfare and rarely mentioned it early in his presidential campaign.Abortion has become a political minefield for Republicans since Roe's overturn last year. While some anti-abortion advocates slammed Trump for his remarks his week, others have also been critical of DeSantis for not making clear whether he supports a sweeping federal ban on abortions or leaving the matter to states to regulate.Democrats have emphasized the issue as a means to drive women and independent voters to the ballot box.DeSantis' recent focus on his state's six-week ban could create problems for him in states later in the primary calendar such as New Hampshire and Michigan, which have historically been less receptive to a hard-right candidate.But Mark Donald, an evangelical pastor in Iowa, cited DeSantis' position on abortion as one reason he was backing him after supporting Trump in the last two elections.Trump’s view of abortion “seems to me more of a position than a conviction, and I support candidates with conviction,” Donald said.He said he would network with other pastors to urge them to support DeSantis.“They have to make a decision: Trump versus the creator,” he said. “That’s where the rubber meets the road.”",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-desantis/analysis-desantis-embraces-risky-abortion-stance-to-draw-contrast-with-trump-idUSKBN30S0Q6,reuters,2023-09-22,"['analysis', 'desantis',

68,Euro zone economy likely contracted this quarter | Reuters,2023-09-22 07:47:00-04:00,") - The euro zone economy is likely contract this quarter and won't return to growth anytime soon, a survey showed, as the dampening effect of central banks' long campaign of interest rates rises becomes clearer.HCOB's flash euro zone Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by S&P Global and seen as a good gauge of overall economic health, rose to 47.1 in September from August's 33-month low of 46.7.The reading was still below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, however, and Hamburg Commercial Bank said the bloc's economy would contract 0.4% this quarter, far worse than the flatlining predicted in a recent Reuters poll.""A recession is becoming increasingly clear in the euro area. Unlike in the winter half-year of 2022/23, the economic weakness is not concentrated in Germany, which has suffered particularly badly from high energy prices,"" said Christoph Weil at Commerzbank.""The increase in the ECB key interest rate by 450 basis points in the meantime is slowing down the economy in all euro countries.""Although two years of unprecedented global policy tightening may have reached a peak, major central banks have served notice they will keep interest rates as high as needed to defeat inflation.The impact is now being clearly felt, with shrinking business activity in Germany, Europe's largest economy, pointing to a contraction there due to a sustained decline in demand for goods and services.Meanwhile France's dominant services sector contracted at an even sharper pace in September, its PMI showed, as falls in demand and new orders weighed on the euro zone's second-biggest economy.In Britain, outside the European Union, companies endured a much tougher September than feared, marked by growing unemployment and recession risks.The Bank of England - which had access to the PMI data - halted its long run of interest rate increases on Thursday as Britain's economy has slowed and inflation fallen, but Governor Andrew Bailey sought to stress the central bank did not think its job was done.Conversely in Spain, gross domestic product grew 0.5% last quarter, confirming a faster and stronger rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic than in many other places.September's fall in overall activity in the euro zone came despite firms barely increasing their charges. The composite output prices index dropped to its lowest since early 2021.That drop will likely be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank who last week raised their key interest rate to a record high of 4% in their fight against inflation.The services PMI rose to 48.4 from 47.9 but spent its second month below the breakeven mark this year.With higher borrowing costs eating into indebted consumers' disposable income they cut back on spending.

69,Karabakh Armenians say no deal yet with Azerbaijan on guarantees or amnesty | Reuters,2023-09-22 08:37:00-04:00,") - The ethnic Armenian leadership of breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh said on Friday that there was no agreement yet with Azerbaijan on security guarantees or an amnesty after a lightening Azeri offensive forced them into a humiliating ceasefire deal.The future of Karabakh and its 120,000 ethnic Armenians hangs in the balance: Azerbaijan wants to integrate the long-contested region, but ethnic Armenians say they fear they will be persecuted and have accused the world of abandoning them.Baku envisages an amnesty for Karabakh Armenian fighters who give up their arms although some have vowed to continue their resistance, Hikmet Hajiyev, foreign policy adviser to Azerbaijan's president, told Reuters.Karabakh Armenians said agreement had not yet been reached.""These questions must still be resolved,"" David Babayan, an adviser to Samvel Shahramanyan, the president of the self-styled Republic of Artsakh, told Reuters. ""There are no concrete results yet.""Babayan said agreement had, however, been reached for an humanitarian convoy to move from Armenia via the Lachin corridor to Karabakh on Friday.""The situation is very difficult: the people are hungry, there is no electricity, no fuel - we have many refugees,"" he said.Seven Russian peacekeeping vehicles, including large trucks, passed an Armenian checkpoint heading towards Nagorno-Karabakh on Friday, a Reuters reporter at the scene said.Azerbaijan's lightening 24-hour military operation this week forced the ethnic Armenians of Karabakh to agree on Wednesday to a ceasefire, stoking calls for the resignation of Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev vowed to guarantee their rights but said his iron fist had consigned the idea of an independent ethnic Armenian Karabakh to history and that the region would be turned into a ""paradise"" as part of Azerbaijan.His country, supported by Turkey, has military superiority over Karabakh fighters. But it is unclear how many of those fighters are prepared to lay down their arms or what shape any more comprehensive agreement now being discussed is taking.Azerbaijan's claim of victory over the region ushers in yet another twist to the tumultuous history of mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh, which over the centuries has come under the sway of Persians, Turks, Russians, Ottomans and Soviets.It could also change the delicate balance of power in the South Caucasus region, a patchwork of ethnicities crisscrossed with oil and gas pipelines where Russia, the United States, Turkey and Iran are jostling for influence.Azerbaijani presidential foreign policy adviser Hajiyev said that Baku envisaged an amnesty for those Karabakh fighters who gave up their weapons.""Even with regard to former militaries and combatants, if they can be classified in such a way, and even for them we are envisaging an amnesty or alluding to an amnesty as well,"" Hajiyev said.Karabakh Armenian rights would be respected as part of their integration into Azerbaijan, he said, adding that they had requested humanitarian support as well as fuel supplies. Three cargos of humanitarian help would be delivered to the region on Friday, he said.""Currently we are seeing that some individual army groups and officers that made the public statements that they won't come to our terms and will continue resistance,"" he said.""But we do not see that to be the biggest challenge, and big security challenge. Of course this will cause certain challenges and difficulties but not on a such a big scale.""Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of mainly Muslim Azerbaijan, but its Christian Armenian population has held de facto independence since breaking away in a war in the 1990s as the Soviet Union collapsed.After a 2020 war in which Azerbaijan was victorious, Armenia's Pashinyan was forced to accept Azerbaijan's control over a much larger territory.Many of the 120,000 Armenians of Karabakh say they have been abandoned by Russia, the West and Armenia itself - and have repeatedly said they fear persecution at the hands of Azerbaijan, which is supported by Turkey.Thousands of Karabakh Armenians were still massed at the local airport where some Russian peacekeepers are based, according to pictures posted on social media.""We need to see a commitment from the international community, not its indifference,"" said Ruben Vardanyan, a former State Minister of the breakaway government.Babayan said there was no large-scale movement of people yet as the area was effectively under siege.Armenia's Pashinyan, who has faced protests in Yerevan calling for him to resign over Karabakh, said that the government had prepared space for a possible flow of people into Armenia but that it did not want to depopulate Karabakh.""We must do everything... so that our compatriots, residents of Nagorno-Karabakh have the opportunity to live in their homes without fear, with dignity and safe,"" he said, adding that his country was the subject of an information war.He cautioned earlier in the week that unidentified forces were talking of a coup against him.Russia, which has just under 2,000 peacekeepers in Karabakh, has called for calm but has been accused by some Armenians including Pashinyan of not doing enough to support Armenia.In a video posted on social media, two men were shown throwing red paint at the Russian embassy in Yerevan.",https://www.reuters.com/article/armenia-azerbaijan/karabakh-armenians-say-no-deal-yet-with-azerbaijan-on-guarantees-or-amnesty-idUSKBN30S0A6,reuters,2023-09-22,"['karabakh', 'armenian',

70,Exclusive-UAW to announce progress with Ford ahead of further auto walkouts ,2023-09-21 21:03:00-04:00,") -The United Auto Workers will say it has made real progress towards a deal with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) but expand its strikes against rival automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), according to sources familiar with talks. The union will also invite President Joe Biden to come to the picket lines, a source said. The UAW last week launched unprecedented, simultaneous strikes at one assembly plant each of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis, but analysts expect any wider strike will include plants that build highly profitable pickup trucks like GM's Chevy Silverado and Stellantis' Ram. UAW President Shawn Fain said earlier this week further strikes could be avoided if companies showed ""significant progress"" toward an agreement. It was not immediately clear if Ford would avoid wider walkouts. The UAW did not immediately comment.Ford did not immediately comment. Ford shares gained 4.4% on the news. GM shares were up 0.4%, giving back earlier gains following the news. GM did not immediately comment. Stellantis said the company is continuing to meet with the union. The strike is expected to expand to at least six additional GM and Stellantis facilities in Michigan, the sources said.About 12,700 workers walked out at plants in Missouri, Michigan and Ohio, which produce the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, alongside other popular models. Long walkouts at factories producing large pickup trucks could cost the automakers billions in revenue and profit. Analysts estimate the automakers earn as much as $15,000 per vehicle on each of their respective large pickup models.The standoff is fueling worries about prolonged industrial action that could disrupt production and ripple through the supply chain and dent U.S. economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday shows significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers.The strike has become a focus of attention for Biden and Republican candidates who want to replace him. An invitation by the UAW to Biden would be a notable overture by the union to the White House, which it has held at arm's length until now. White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre was asked Thursday if Biden plans to visit a picket line. She declined to answer but said ""all parties continuing to be at the negotiating table is a positive. It is important that we result in a win-win agreement."" The White House did not immediately comment on Friday. Fain has said the Detroit automakers have not shared their huge profits with workers while enriching executives and investors. GM President Mark Reuss this week rejected those claims, saying the current offer to the union would be generous and the company's profits have been reinvested in the transition to electric vehicles. The automakers have proposed 20% raises over 4-1/2 years, while the UAW is seeking 40%.The union also wants to end a tiered wage structure that it says has created a large gap between newer and older employees. S&P said the strikes, which began on Sept. 15, were highly likely to last several weeks, potentially cutting third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product by 0.4% and causing ""upheaval"" across global automotive supply chains. GM, Ford and Stellantis have said they are making contingency plans for further U.S. work stoppages.Ford reached a last-minute deal to avoid a walkout at its Canadian operations late on Tuesday. Unifor, which represents about 5,600 Canadian auto workers, had been threatening to go on strike at all three Ford plants in the country.

73,Apple workers in France stage strike on iPhone 15 launch day ,2023-09-22 01:54:00-04:00,") -Workers at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stores in France began a nationwide strike over pay and working conditions on Friday in a protest designed to coincide with the launch of the iPhone 15. It is the latest headache for the tech giant in France after it was forced to stop selling its iPhone 12 model earlier this month for above-threshold radiation. Apple disputes the findings of the French watchdog.About 30 staff were picketing outside the company's store in Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) in central Paris, one of three in the French capital, a few metres away from a line of about 40 customers waiting in the rain to enter the shop.""We are still the people who make Apple's wealth, and therefore I think that we deserve a little more honorable treatment than what we are given today,"" said Anais Durel, a 36-year old who has worked for Apple for 10 years.A CGT union official said that ""a few hundred"" of Apple France's retail staff of about 2,300 had participated in the strike. He added that all the Apple France stores had remained open on Friday, albeit with lower staffing levels. Apple declined to comment.Apple unions including CGT, Unsa, CFDT and Cidre-CFTC, which also plan to strike on Saturday, have asked for a 7% wage increase to compensate for inflation, and an end to a months-long hiring freeze. Management did not want to offer more than a 4.5% hike, union officials said.""Inflation is still quite nasty. There are a lot of employees who are experiencing difficulties,"" said Tarek, a CGT union leader who declined to give his last name.""The goal is not at all to block sales of the iPhone, the goal is really to bring awareness to this situation,"" he added.Staff at an Apple store in Barcelona, where about 250 people were queuing to enter the store on Friday morning, were set to join colleagues in France in protesting.About 20 workers will set up an information picket outside the store on Paseo de Gracia in central Barcelona at midday, Pablo Paredes, leader of the CNT Apple union, told Reuters.Paredes said the workers aim to highlight poor working conditions including contracts which do not compensate them for working at weekends or at night.CNT is a minority union and only active in one of Barcelona's two stores.

Position added successfully to: 
The solar energy industry has faced a tough year in 2023, with solar stocks experiencing a downward trend after an initial boost from the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. The Invesco Solar ETF (Exchange: Ticker), which had seen an impressive rise of 233.6% in 2020, is down by over 25% year-to-date and has remained largely flat over the past three years. Yet, the solar industry's long-term growth potential remains robust, attracting investors to promising segments within the sector.A global price war among solar panel manufacturers has negatively impacted the industry but has also benefited project operators due to reduced panel costs. However, higher interest rates have decreased the return on investment for utility-scale solar projects and deterred residential buyers from installing rooftop solar by extending the payback period on their initial investment. Geopolitical disruptions have also led energy-dependent countries to lean towards oil and gas resources, adding further pressure to the renewable energy sector.Despite these challenges, investors continue to show interest in the Invesco Solar ETF. The fund offers a balanced mix of renewable energy equipment and information technology companies such as Enphase and SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG). It also includes more than 37% of utilities and industrial companies, with over 45% of the fund allocated to companies outside the United States, providing exposure to international markets like China, Germany, and Spain.Enphase and SolarEdge represent the largest and third-largest holdings in the fund respectively, accounting for nearly 20% of the total fund's holdings. Despite significant sell-offs, both companies have maintained solid fundamentals with stable margins in what has been a challenging period for the solar inverter and power optimizer market, particularly in Europe.Despite potential slowdowns and margin pressures, both Enphase and SolarEdge offer value to investors who believe these companies can maintain their high margins and growth over time. Even with their current lower valuations - Enphase at a 23.4 forward price-to-earnings ratio and SolarEdge at 14.7 -, these stocks may start to look attractive if growth returns and margins remain stronger than expected.For those considering an investment in the international solar industry, the Invesco Solar ETF remains a strong option. However, a split investment between Enphase and SolarEdge could prove to be an even more strategic move. Both companies have demonstrated strong fundamentals and have thus far resisted price wars, competition, and margin compression. Despite recent setbacks, these stocks are now more affordable than they once were. Patience may be required as conditions could worsen before they improve, but now could be an opportune time for a closer look at Enphase and SolarEdge.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

79,Morgan Stanley stays positive on XPeng following 2-day correction ,2023-09-22 06:06:00-04:00,"Position added successfully to: 
Morgan Stanley reiterated their Overweight rating on Chinese electric automaker, XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) and maintained their 12-month price target of $25.40 on the stock after a 12-14% ADR/H-shr correction over the past 2 days stirred investor attention.XPeng recently released a redesigned G9 SUV with more aggressive pricing and a streamlined model/spec portfolio that has generated feedback from the channels.Analyst conversations with supply indicate that the G9 has garnered 4,000 to 5,000 confirmed orders since its official launch on September 19, with the potential for a significant increase in orders expected during the upcoming weekend. The attractive value proposition of the G9 Max has been a factor in enticing some customers to upgrade from the G6, which can be viewed as a positive development. The risk associated with G9 sales is tilted towards the positive side, considering the low expectations stemming from its unsuccessful launch a year ago.Investors view the aggressive pricing strategy of the G9 as a double-edged sword that could potentially impact the group's profit margin. However, Morgan Stanley does not anticipate a significant decline in margin, as the planned vehicle gross margins for the existing G6, the redesigned G9, and the upcoming LFPP7i are expected to be in the mid to high single digits.While it is expected that substantial margin improvement may not materialize this year, it is clear that building volume is the primary priority for XPeng to establish confidence in the capital markets, among consumers, and within the supply chain.Shares of XPEV are up 4.53% in early trading on Friday.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/morgan-stanley-stays-positive-on-xpeng-following-2day-correction-432SI-3180694,investing.com,2023-09-22,"['morgan', 'stanley', 'stay', 'positive', 'xpeng', 'follow', 'correction', 'position', 'add', 'successfully', 'morgan', 'stanley', 'reiterate', 'overweight', 'rating', 'chinese', 'electric', 'automaker', 'xpeng', 'nyse', 'xpev', 'maintain', 'price', 'target', 'stock', 'correction', 'past', 'day', 'stir', 'investor', 'recently', 'release', 'redesign', 'suv', 'aggressive', 'pricing', 'streamline', 'portfolio', 'generate', 'feedback', 'conversation', 'supply', 'indicate', 'garner', 'confirmed', 'order', 'since', 'official', 'launch', 'september', 'potential', 'significant', 'increase', 'order', 'expect', 'upcoming', 'weekend', 'the', 'attractive', 'value', 'proposition', 'max', 'factor', 'entice', 'customer', 'upgrade', 'view', 'positive', 'development', 'the', 'risk', 'associate', 'sale', 'tilt', 'towards', 'positive', 'side', 'consider', 'low', 'expectation', 'stem', 'unsuccessful', 'launch', 'year', 'view', 'aggressive', 'pricing', 'strategy', 'sword', 'could', 'potentially', 'impact', 'group', 'profit', 'margin', 'however', 'morgan', 'stanley', 'anticipate', 'significant', 'decline', 'margin', 'plan', 'vehicle', 'gross', 'margin', 'exist', 'redesign', 'upcoming', 'expect', 'mid', 'high', 'single', 'expect', 'substantial', 'margin', 'improvement', 'may', 'materialize', 'year', 'clear', 'building', 'volume', 'primary', 'priority', 'xpeng', 'establish', 'confidence', 'capital', 'market', 'among', 'consumer', 'within', 'supply', 'xpev', 'early', 'trading', 'friday']"

Friday, September 22, 2023 - Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the cryptocurrency, cannabis, and clean energy sectors experienced significant lending revenues last year, despite substantial losses due to poor market performance. The most lucrative lending returns were linked to the least popular stocks on the market, leaving investors in a challenging position.Securities lending, a practice where ETFs lend out their held securities to traders such as hedge funds looking to short stocks, typically provides minor additional revenue for ETFs and mutual funds. However, in 2021, certain niche US thematic funds obtained unusually high fees from stock lending. The Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF led the pack with revenues equivalent to 3.2% of its assets from securities lending last year, equating to 524% of its net expense ratio. The Global X Cannabis ETF and the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF followed closely with revenues of 2.87% and 2.81% respectively.These three ETFs experienced losses between 67% and 85% last year due to poor market performance in the crypto and cannabis sectors. This attracted short sellers who borrowed shares to circumvent SEC-imposed short-selling time limits.Morningstar identified 20 US-listed ETFs that received lending revenues of at least 0.59% of their assets last year. The list was heavily skewed towards digital assets and technology sectors that were most affected by the market crash. Only one fund on this list, iShares Interest Rate Hedged High Yield Bond ETF, managed to outperform the Morningstar US Market Index's decline of 19.4%.Invesco was a significant player in this space, with five of the top 10 ETFs lending revenue as a percentage of assets. According to Anna Paglia, global head of ETFs and indexed strategies at Invesco, the firm returned more than $100 million to fund investors in lending revenues last year.Despite these high revenues, lending earnings for larger, mainstream funds were typically more modest. The average Vanguard fund received just 2.31 basis points of revenue last year, while the typical BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) or iShares fund received 2.12 basis points. Vanguard distinguished itself by passing 97% of the securities lending revenue to its investors from February 2022 to June 2023, ahead of SSGA's 79.1%, Invesco's 77%, and BlackRock/iShares' 74.5%.

82,U.S. stocks are mixed as investors digest message of higher rates for longer ,2023-09-21 15:36:00-04:00," -- U.S. stocks are mixed in early trading Friday, headed for a weekly loss after the Federal Reserve sent the message that interest rates will be higher for longer as it tries to battle inflation.At 9:52 ET (13:52 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 53 points or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.1% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.4%.The main indices on Wall Street closed sharply lower Thursday, as bond yields surged in the wake of the Fed meeting, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbing to its highest level since 2007.This has pressured the Nasdaq Composite, which is on track to drop 3.5% this week, which would be its worst week since March. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average stands 1.6% lower so far this week, while the broad-based S&P 500 is on course to drop 2.7%.The Fed held rates steady this week, but signaled it might raise them one more time this year and keep them elevated for longer than anticipated as it tries to slay inflation. The U.S. central bank Fed officials also signaled two rate cuts next year, half the number they anticipated in their last round of forecasts in June.The U.S. economic data slate will center around the purchasing managers index reports for September on Friday.

In a recent Investor Day presentation, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), the advertising-reliant platform, projected an optimistic outlook for its business, despite the ongoing challenges in the advertising sector. The company's management expects a ""high-single-digit range"" revenue growth for the third quarter of 2023, surpassing its second-quarter year-over-year revenue growth rate of 6%.The projected growth rate indicates a positive trend and an acceleration from the company's performance over the last three quarters. By comparison, Pinterest's revenue grew by 8% year-over-year in Q3 2022, while competitors like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) saw a 4% decline in revenue.Julia Donnelly, Pinterest's Chief Financial Officer, underscored the significance of this guidance during the presentation. She stated that the company aims to outpace the overall market in terms of revenue growth through various strategies, targeting a mid to high-teens compound annual growth rate over the next three to five years.However, Donnelly cautioned investors about an important assumption inherent in their optimistic guidance: it is based on a ""stabilized to slightly improving digital advertising market"" in the future. This assumption aligns with current market conditions, suggesting that Pinterest's positive outlook is predicated on a steady state.The projected revenue growth could be beneficial not only for Pinterest but also for other tech companies heavily reliant on digital advertising revenues. In this challenging landscape characterized by high interest rates and inflationary pressures, forecasting ad spend can be daunting. Many companies whose revenues are predominantly ad-driven are trading below their peak values.In related news from earlier this month, connected-TV operating system provider  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) also reported positive news. The company increased its third-quarter revenue guidance and now anticipates a Q3 revenue growth rate as high as 15%. As a significant part of Roku's business is derived from advertising revenue, this metric provides further optimism for stakeholders in the digital advertising space.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The news was announced on Friday, as the former U.S. Ambassador to Israel is set to join the San Francisco-based bank as vice chairman and a member of its operating committee.Nides will be succeeding William Daley, who plans to retire at the end of the year. Daley, a trusted lieutenant to Chief Executive Charlie Scharf, joined Wells Fargo in 2019 as vice chairman of the newly created public affairs group.In his new role, Nides will report directly to Scharf and work closely with division heads to expand relationships with key clients. He is expected to use his extensive experience across the public and private sectors to advise Scharf and senior management on various issues, including banking and management.Before joining Wells Fargo, Nides spent nearly a decade at Morgan Stanley, serving in various roles such as chief operating officer, managing director, and vice chairman. His tenure at Morgan Stanley was interspersed with a stint as deputy secretary of state for management and resources in the Obama administration.The appointment of Nides comes at a crucial time for Wells Fargo, which is still navigating multiple outstanding legal and regulatory issues arising from years of scandal. The bank is currently operating under a Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap limiting its size to what it was at the end of 2017.Nides is expected to start at Wells Fargo next month.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Despite this downturn, the firm's strong financial health points towards potential for long-term growth in stock value, often a reward from the market for financially stable companies.A key performance indicator that demonstrates IDT's financial health is its Return on Equity (ROE), which stands at 26%. The ROE is calculated by dividing the net profit from ongoing operations by shareholders' equity. This figure indicates that IDT generated a profit of $0.26 for every dollar of its shareholder's investments, based on data from the trailing twelve months up to April 2023.The relationship between ROE and earnings growth is significant. A high ROE can serve as an effective measure of a company's future earnings. The potential for earnings growth can be gauged based on how much profit the company retains or reinvests and how effectively it does so. Companies with high ROE and profit retention typically have a higher growth rate compared to those lacking these attributes.In IDT's case, its high ROE surpasses the telecom industry average of 11%. Given these factors, it is not surprising that IDT has seen significant net income growth over the past five years, with an increase of 47%. This suggests that despite recent share price decline, IDT's robust financial health may indicate potential for long-term growth.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

88,Stifel sees potential for positive shift; upgrades Volkswagen to Buy ,2023-09-22 05:35:00-04:00,"Position added successfully to: 
Stifel upgraded German automaker, Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) to a Buy rating (From Hold), maintaining their 12-month price target of €149.00 (€1 = $1.0647) on the stock.VW is currently grappling with structural obstacles and experiencing shortcomings in its corporate governance. Nevertheless, Stifel believes that there is potential for a positive shift in the company's narrative in the coming months.Analysts are expecting to receive more information about the €10 billion cost-saving initiative in October or November. Additionally, the forthcoming electric vehicle launches will be based on the new PPE platform.It is also worth noting that the average age of VW and Audi brand portfolios has reached its highest point, and the workforce's average age at VW is on the rise due to natural attrition.VW's CFO anticipates a challenging period over the next 2-3 years as the company concurrently invests in EVs and Internal Combustion Engines. The IFO index for OEMs has reached a historic low, indicating a tough environment. Order intake remains weak, and there's a notable discrepancy between the current consensus for 2024 and the reality on the ground.VW has underperformed the sector by 21% year-to-date and by 30% over the past year. Negotiations between management and labor unions regarding cost reductions are at a crucial stage, with Stifel expecting results to emerge in October or November. During this critical period, poor developments in VW's operational activities might unexpectedly be viewed as favorable news since they could potentially facilitate the company's cost-cutting initiatives.Analysts wrote in a note, “VW is a risky call, given the long term challenges and weak order intake in the short term. However, against a record negative sentiment, 30% share price underperformance over one year and an opportunity to cut cost we upgrade to Buy.”",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stifel-sees-potential-for-positive-shift-upgrades-volkswagen-to-buy-432SI-3180664,investing.com,2023-09-22,"['stifel', 'see', 'potential', 'positive', 'shift', 'upgrade', 'volkswagen', 'buy', 'position', 'add', 'successfully', 'stifel', 'upgraded', 'german', 'automaker', 'volkswagen', 'etr', 'buy', 'rating', 'from', 'hold', 'maintain', 'price', 'target', 'currently', 'grapple', 'structural', 'obstacle', 'experience', 'shortcoming', 'corporate', 'governance', 'nevertheless', 'stifel', 'believe', 'potential', 'positive', 'shift', 'company', 'narrative', 'come', 'expect', 'receive', 'information', 'billion', 'initiative', 'october', 'november', 'additionally', 'forthcoming', 'electric', 'vehicle', 'launch', 'base', 'new', 'ppe', 'also', 'worth', 'note', 'average', 'age', 'vw', 'audi', 'brand', 'portfolio', 'reach', 'high', 'point', 'workforce', 'average', 'age', 'vw', 'rise', 'due', 'natural', 'cfo', 'anticipate', 'challenge', 'period', 'next', 'year', 'company', 'concurrently', 'invest', 'ev', 'internal', 'combustion', 'engine', 'the', 'ifo', 'index', 'oems', 'reach', 'historic', 'low', 'indicate', 'tough', 'environment', 'order', 'intake', 'remain', 'weak', 'notable', 'discrepancy', 'current', 'consensus', 'reality', 'underperform', 'sector', 'past', 'year', 'negotiation', 'management', 'labor', 'union', 'regard', 'cost', 'reduction', 'crucial', 'stage', 'stifel', 'expect', 'result', 'emerge', 'october', 'november', 'during', 'critical', 'period', 'poor', 'development', 'vw', 'operational', 'activity', 'might', 'unexpectedly', 'view', 'favorable', 'news', 'since', 'could', 'potentially', 'facilitate', 'company', 'write', 'note', 'vw', 'risky', 'call', 'give', 'long', 'term', 'challenge', 'weak', 'order', 'intake', 'short', 'term', 'however', 'record', 'negative', 'sentiment', 'share', 'price', 'underperformance', 'one', 'year', 'opportunity', 'cut', 'cost', 'upgrade', 'buy']"
89,California lets insurers factor wildfire risks in rates to widen coverage ,2023-09-21 22:23:00-04:00,") - California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara took steps on Thursday to allow property insurers to factor in climate risks including wildfires in rate prices, if they increase underwriting in at-risk areas to wean consumers off state-funded coverage.Since 2022, seven of the state's top 12 insurers have paused or restricted new business, including State Farm and Liberty Mutual, and the government's Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan, intended as an insurer of last resort, has risen to a 3% share of California's market.""We are at a major crossroads on insurance after multiple years of wildfires and storms intensified by the threat of climate change,"" Lara said in a statement.The measures by the state's insurance regulator follow an executive order by Governor Gavin Newsom urging regulatory action to expand coverage in underserved areas, account for catastrophe risks in rates, and keep the FAIR Plan solvent. A report by broker Gallagher Re in July said U.S. property catastrophe reinsurance rates rose by as much as 50% at a key July 1 renewal date, with states such as California and Florida increasingly hit by wildfires and hurricanes due in part to climate change.The continued retreat of larger insurance carriers from the California residential property insurance market signals ongoing regulatory constraints, rising cost inflation, and higher catastrophe losses, credit rating agency Fitch said in a note earlier this year.

90,"Trump, NY attorney general argue over scope of looming fraud trial ",2023-09-22 02:17:00-04:00,") -Donald Trump's lawyers are trying on Friday to persuade a New York judge to throw out, just 10 days before a scheduled trial, most or all of state Attorney General Letitia James's lawsuit accusing the former U.S. president of ""staggering"" fraud.Lawyers for James, in contrast, are asking the same Manhattan judge to find Trump and other defendants, including his adult sons and his Trump Organization family business, liable for fraud even before a jury starts hearing evidence.Justice Arthur Engoron, who oversees the case, said at Friday's hearing that he expects to rule on the motions on Tuesday, after hearing oral arguments.The trial is scheduled to begin on Oct. 2.It comes as Trump enjoys a dominating lead in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing a slew of litigation including four criminal indictments where he has pleaded not guilty.James has accused Trump of repeatedly lying in financial statements to obtain better terms on loans and insurance.She has said Trump overstated the values of more than 20 properties from 2011 to 2021, including his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and Trump Tower penthouse in Manhattan, and inflating his own fortune by as much as $3.6 billion.Trump has called the lawsuit a ""witch hunt.""His lawyers have argued that James has no authority to sue over private transactions they say were not fraudulent, and that most of her claims fall outside statutes of limitations.They cited a June decision by a state appeals court dismissing claims against Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, and various other claims predating July 2014 or February 2016.The court left it to Engoron to determine which parts could proceed.Last week, Trump accused James of ignoring the decision and Engoron of refusing to implement it, and said the trial should be delayed.That prompted an appeals court judge on Sept. 14 to temporarily stay the trial. A five-judge panel is expected to decide next week whether the trial should proceed.Engoron has chosen not to appear before the panel, and referred it to his prior orders. On Thursday, James called Trump's request for a delay a ""brazen and meritless"" attempt to undermine Engoron's authority.She said even a brief delay ""would likely wreak havoc"" on the trial and other trials that Trump faces.James' lawsuit seeks to bar Trump and his adult sons Donald Jr. And Eric from running businesses in New York. It also seeks at least $250 million of penalties.

92,"Bank of Canada's rate hikes impact consumer spending, retail sales dip ",2023-09-22 06:30:00-04:00,"Position added successfully to: 
The Bank of Canada's increased interest rates appear to be tightening household budgets, leading to a decline in consumer spending. Preliminary data from Statistics Canada showed a 0.3% decrease in retail receipts for August, marking the first drop since March. This downturn follows a less-than-expected 0.3% rise in July, falling short of the anticipated 0.4% increase.In July, seven out of nine subsectors reported sales growth, with food and beverage retailers recording substantial increases. Conversely, motor vehicle and parts dealers experienced the sharpest decline that month, their first in four months. If this sector is excluded, retail sales saw a 1% increase in July, doubling expectations.However, retail sales measured by volume dipped by 0.2% in July, suggesting that Canadian households may be tightening their budgets due to factors such as mortgage payment renewals and high fuel costs. On September 6, the Bank of Canada maintained its borrowing costs, citing evidence that higher rates are effectively slowing economic and consumption growth.After a five-month pause, the central bank resumed hiking interest rates in June and July following observed strength in household spending earlier this year. The next rate decision is expected on October 25, with most economists predicting the bank will maintain its current stance.On a regional level, five provinces reported increased sales in July, led by Quebec and British Columbia. Ontario, however, recorded the largest provincial decrease due to lower sales at motor vehicle and parts dealerships.Statistics Canada noted that approximately 17% of Canadian retailers were affected by the strike at British Columbia ports in July. The most substantial estimated impact on unadjusted sales in dollar terms was seen at motor vehicle and parts dealerships. The agency did not provide further details on their August estimate which was based on responses from slightly less than half of the surveyed companies.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

93,Ark Invest founder questions Nvidia and Arm Holdings valuations amid AI focus ,2023-09-22 05:08:00-04:00,"Position added successfully to: 
Cathie Wood, founder of Ark Invest, has recently expressed reservations about the valuations of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and  Arm  Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), despite Nvidia's presence in Ark's portfolio. This year, Wood significantly reduced Ark's stake in Nvidia due to concerns about overvaluation.Wood discussed her investment strategy on CNBC's Squawk Box Europe program, particularly focusing on artificial intelligence (AI). She hinted at a potential overemphasis on AI within a certain chip stock, which was not Nvidia.Arm Holdings, which had its initial public offering (IPO) last week, is the company Wood believes is overrated for AI. The firm was taken private by SoftBank (TYO:9984) in 2016 for $32 billion and after approximately seven years, it decided to go public again.The IPO for Arm Holdings initially brought in substantial profits with share prices soaring nearly 25% on the first day of trading on September 14. However, Arm's stock has since dropped close to 20%.During her Squawk Box Europe interview, Wood voiced two main reservations about Arm. Firstly, she expressed concerns about the company's high valuation, similar to her apprehensions about Nvidia. Secondly, she questioned whether Arm's growth prospects are as promising as some might believe. Despite dominating the smartphone chip market, Arm has yet to make significant strides in AI.However, Wood clarified that her criticisms were not aimed at AI as a whole. She remains confident in the immense potential of AI and believes that innovation in this field is undervalued considering the opportunities it presents.Wood also highlighted that her funds own lower-priced names with more exposure to AI than Arm. In addition to focusing on U.S. companies, Ark is also considering global opportunities as technology costs decrease due to advancements in AI.A review of Ark Invest's portfolio across all its exchange-traded funds reinforces Wood's faith in AI, with two of Ark's top three holdings, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and UiPath, being AI stocks.Even after its post-IPO decline, Arm's stock trades at more than 55x forward earnings, surpassing Nvidia's forward earnings multiple of nearly 40x. This overvaluation and the overestimation of Arm's AI prospects raises questions about Wood's accuracy.Arm's AI prospects present two different narratives. In the short term, it seems unlikely that AI will significantly boost Arm. Currently, data centers, where Nvidia's chips are prevalent, are the primary growth area for AI. However, in the long term (beyond five years), it is plausible that AI processing could shift more towards mobile devices, potentially making Arm a significant player in AI.Wood remains optimistic about the future of AI technology and suggests that investors with a long-term perspective should place more emphasis on AI.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The Indian stock market experienced a significant decline this week, with the Sensex dropping 571 points due to the US Federal Reserve's continued hawkish stance on rates. This comes after an impressive streak where the index gained over 3,000 points in 11 consecutive sessions. Power producer SJVN's stock price crashed by 13% on Friday due to concerns about excessive supply following the government's decision to divest stake in the company.Earlier in the week, the Indian government announced plans to sell a 5% stake in SJVN through an offer for sale (OFS) route. The OFS is priced at Rs 69 per share, offering a 15.6% discount to Wednesday's closing price of Rs 82. The base size of the offer is 9.7 crore shares, with an option for additional shares. This move could generate approximately Rs 1,334 crore and reduce the government's stake in SJVN to about 55%. The Himachal state government currently holds around 27% in the company.The US central bank's hawkish stance on rates has left investors jittery as prospects of future rate hikes rose, pulling down global markets. On Thursday, the Sensex fell by 571 points to 66,230. In three sessions, the index lost about 1,600 points after gaining over 3,000 points in 11 consecutive sessions.According to Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, domestic markets slid for the third consecutive day after the US Fed’s hawkish stance in its policy meeting. ""Uncertain global cues and persistent selling by FIIs are likely to keep markets under pressure in the near term,"" Khemka said.Foreign portfolio investors have net sold stocks worth about Rs 11,300 crore so far this month, after remaining net buyers for six consecutive months since March. Rising crude oil prices, weakness of the rupee, and continued selling by foreign investors also contributed to the negative sentiment in the Indian market.Indian shares closed lower on Friday, with the benchmark Sensex logging its worst week in over 15 months due to lingering worries over a higher global interest rate environment following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish tone. The main Nifty 50 index closed down 0.34% at 19,674.25 points, while the S&P BSE Sensex fell 0.33% to 66,009.15 points. Both indexes had hit their all-time highs last week.Higher interest rates dry up liquidity from the markets, increasing the cost of capital. Foreign investors have been net sellers so far this month, offloading shares worth $996.2 million as of Sept. 20, as per National Securities Depository Ltd data. Foreign inflows into Indian equities were $15.45 billion this year, compared with $16.5 billion of outflows last year, as per LSEG data.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

97,"McDonald's to raise royalty fees for new franchise restaurants in US, Canada ",2023-09-22 03:08:00-04:00,") -McDonald's is raising royalty fees for new franchise restaurants in the U.S. and Canada for the first time in nearly three decades, according to a letter viewed by Reuters on Friday, bringing them on par with what it charges in other markets.The fees are being hiked to 5% from 4%, starting Jan. 1, and will not affect franchises that are looking to rebuild or renovate existing locations or transfer an outlet to another party, the letter showed.The move comes as the restaurant chain sees slowing revenue growth for the rest of the year as signs of easing inflation prompt it to lower menu prices. Northcoast Research analyst Jim Sanderson, however, said the impact of the rate increase on McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) revenue would be ""very limited"", since there are very few new stores opening in the United States.The fast-food giant operates around 13,400 stores across the United States. Around 95% of these were operated by franchisees as of Dec. 31, making up nearly 30% of the company's total revenue in 2022.Average cash flows for these U.S. franchisees have grown more than 35% over the past five years, the letter showed.The company will also change the term for payments from ""service fees"" to ""royalty fees"", used by all other McDonald's markets around the world.Royalty is a fee paid by restaurant operators to the owner and the rate is set based on the revenue generated by the licensed property.

The US chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is reportedly planning job cuts at its Shanghai office, amid escalating technology tensions between the US and China, as well as ongoing economic challenges. The company confirmed the layoffs but has not disclosed the exact number of job reductions. This move follows Qualcomm's previously announced expectations of ""workforce reductions"" in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 as part of its restructuring efforts to invest in key growth opportunities.Despite the layoffs, Qualcomm has denied plans for an office closure or a complete withdrawal from Shanghai, according to China Business News. An anonymous employee also confirmed that the layoffs were underway, but suggested they were not extensive.The company, which has a presence in over 12 Chinese cities primarily for its semiconductor and mobile telecommunications businesses, has emphasized its commitment to developing advanced technology in China. It is offering generous redundancy packages to affected employees.Qualcomm's decision comes in the wake of a challenging financial period. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, it reported a 23% year-on-year drop in revenue and a 52% decline in net income due to weak demand for consumer electronics.Additional pressure comes from ongoing US-China trade tensions and Beijing’s partial ban on iPhone usage by government staff, as Qualcomm is a major supplier to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, the successful launch of the new iPhone 15 in Mainland China could alleviate some of these challenges.The broader smartphone market in China has also faced difficulties, with a 4% decline in sales during the second quarter of 2023, marking the lowest second-quarter sales since 2014, according to market research firm Counterpoint.

The artificial intelligence (AI) industry, which automates tasks traditionally performed by humans through software and systems, has seen a significant boom in 2023. As investors' primary focus, the sector's success is largely attributed to machine learning, with applications spanning various industries. According to PwC, AI could contribute an additional $15.7 trillion to the economy by 2030, including $6.6 trillion from increased productivity and a $9.1 trillion boost in consumption.Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a graphics processing unit (GPU) specialist, has made significant strides amidst this AI surge. As the fiscal year 2024 began for Nvidia in early February, Wall Street anticipated high-single-digit sales growth for the company. However, after two quarters, analysts now predict a 103% sales increase in 2024, raising sales estimates from just under $30 billion to nearly $55 billion within seven months.The majority of this growth is attributed to revenue from data centers. Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs have gained dominance in high-compute data centers, making Nvidia a critical infrastructure component of the AI revolution. Nevertheless, Nvidia might face challenges in 2024 due to potential expansion in AI GPU production.Nvidia's data center sales have soared primarily due to the maxed-out production of its A100 and H100 GPUs. The shortage of AI-accelerated GPUs and significant pricing power have collectively propelled Nvidia's gross margin higher. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), whose chip-on-wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity is currently at its limit, plays a pivotal role here. TSMC is expected to double its CoWoS capacity soon, aiming to increase from 8,000 wafers per month to 11,000 by year's end, and further to between 14,500 and 16,600 by the end of 2024.However, as Nvidia expands production to meet customer needs, it will face higher costs. As its A100 and H100 GPUs become less scarce, Nvidia's pricing power will likely decrease, impacting its gross profit margin. This margin jumped to 68.2% during the first half of fiscal 2024 from 55.7% in the comparable period in fiscal 2023 but could decline as production increases.Competition in the sector is also set to intensify. In June, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) introduced the MI300X, its most advanced GPU for AI-accelerated data centers. While AMD plans to ramp up sales in 2024, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) also plans to release its Falcon Shores GPU in 2025 to compete directly with Nvidia in high-compute data centers.Furthermore, history suggests that after a period of euphoria, next-big-thing investments often fail to meet investors' high expectations initially.

101,Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services’ IPO Opens at Muted Rs 164 Amid Market Concerns ,2023-09-22 06:16:00-04:00,"Zaggle Prepaid Ocean Services, a significant entity in the fintech industry, opened its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday at a subdued Rs 164 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Rs 162 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). By mid-morning, the company's shares were trading at Rs 166.6 on the NSE and Rs 166 on the BSE, aligning with analysts' expectations.Despite this alignment, Anubhuti Mishra, an Equity Research Analyst at Swastika Investment, warned that market sentiment fluctuations could impact the listing. The IPO's aggressive pricing at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 66.6x for FY23 earnings was also highlighted as a potential concern by StoxBox analysts. This P/E ratio is significantly higher than Zaggle's listed peers.Further financial indicators have raised concerns among analysts. Notably, Zaggle's high debt-to-equity ratio prompted StoxBox to advise investors to sell their shares on the opening day. The company's business model, which heavily relies on third parties, combined with its negative cash flow and declining profitability in recent years, has also been flagged as a potential issue.Swastika Investmart echoed these sentiments and recommended investors exit their positions due to these financial concerns. However, for those wishing to hold their shares for potential gains, they advised maintaining a stop loss at Rs 148.The fintech sector is known for its fierce competition, which could affect Zaggle's earnings prospects. This scenario underscores the importance of careful consideration of investment decisions and monitoring market trends and company performance. As always, consulting with certified experts before making any investment decisions is highly recommended.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

102,US Senator Menendez hit with bribery charges over Egypt ties | Reuters,2023-09-22 10:37:00-04:00,") - U.S. Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, and his wife have been charged with bribery offenses in connection with their relationship with three New Jersey businessmen, federal prosecutors said on Friday.The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan accused the defendants of accepting thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for using Menendez's power and influence as a senator to seek to protect and enrich the businessmen, and benefit the government of Egypt.Prosecutors said the bribes included cash, gold, payments toward a home mortgage, compensation for a job with minimal requirements, a luxury vehicle and other things of value.Menendez, the chair of the influential U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and his wife Nadine Menendez, who has been married to the senator since 2020, face three criminal counts each.The senator's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Menendez is up for re-election next year, and an investigation could complicate Democrats' effort to expand their slim 51-49 seat majority in the 100-member Senate.Menendez and his wife face three criminal counts each: conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, and conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right.Prosecutors are seeking to have Menendez forfeit assets including his New Jersey home, a 2019 Mercedes-Benz, and about $566,000 in cash, gold bars, and funds from a bank account.The businessmen - Wael Hana, Jose Uribe, and Fred Daibes - were also charged in the scheme.Prosecutors said Hana, who is originally from Egypt, arranged dinners and meetings between Menendez and Egyptian officials in 2018 at which the officials pressed Menendez on the status of U.S. military aid. In exchange, Hana put Nadine Menendez on his company's payroll, prosecutors said.Egypt at the time was one of the largest recipients of U.S. military aid, but the State Department had withheld $195 million in 2017 and canceled an additional $65.7 million until the country could demonstrate improvements on human rights and democracy.Menendez at a meeting in 2018 told Hana non-public information about the status of the aid, prosecutors said. Hana then texted an Egyptian official, ""The ban on small arms and ammunition to Egypt has been lifted,"" according to an indictment made public on Friday.Prosecutors said Egypt’s government in 2019 granted one of Hana’s companies an exclusive license to export halal food from the United States to Egypt, despite lacking experience in halal certification. Hana used the proceeds from those exports to fund the bribe payments, according to the indictment.The Egyptian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Damian Williams, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, was set to address the charges at an 11 a.m. EDT (1356 GMT) press conference.Menendez had previously been charged in New Jersey with accepting private flights, campaign contributions and other bribes from a wealthy patron in exchange for official favors, but a 2017 trial ended in a jury deadlock.Prosecutors dropped their bribery case in 2018 and Menendez had maintained his innocence.He was re-elected later that year to his third term in the Senate, which he first joined in 2006.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-politics-menendez/us-senator-menendez-hit-with-bribery-charges-over-egypt-ties-idUSKBN30S141,reuters,2023-09-22,"['u', 'senator', 'menendez', 'hit', 'bribery', 'charge', 'egypt', 'tie', 'reuters', 'senator', 'robert', 'menendez', 'democrat', 'new', 'jersey', 'wife', 'charge', 'bribery', 'offense', 'connection', 'relationship', 'three', 'new', 'jersey', 'businessmen', 'federal', 'prosecutor', 'say', 'attorney', 'office', 'manhattan', 'accuse', 'defendant', 'accept', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'bribe', 'exchange', 'use', 'menendez', 'power', 'influence', 'senator', 'seek', 'protect', 'enrich', 'businessmen', 'benefit', 'government', 'say', 'bribe', 'include', 'cash', 'gold', 'payment', 'toward', 'home', 'mortgage', 'compensation', 'job', 'minimal', 'requirement', 'luxury', 'vehicle', 'thing', 'chair', 'influential', 'senate', 'committee', 'foreign', 'relation', 'wife', 'nadine', 'menendez', 'marry', 'senator', 'since', 'face', 'three', 'criminal', 'count', 'senator', 'office', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'next', 'year', 'investigation', 'could', 'complicate', 'democrat', 'effort', 'expand', 'slim', 'seat', 'majority', 'wife', 'face', 'three', 'criminal', 'count', 'conspiracy', 'commit', 'bribery', 'conspiracy', 'commit', 'honest', 'service', 'fraud', 'conspiracy', 'commit', 'extortion', 'color', 'official', 'seek', 'menendez', 'forfeit', 'asset', 'include', 'new', 'jersey', 'home', 'cash', 'gold', 'bar', 'fund', 'bank', 'businessmen', 'wael', 'hana', 'jose', 'uribe', 'fred', 'daibes', 'also', 'charge', 'say', 'hana', 'originally', 'egypt', 'arrange', 'dinner', 'meeting', 'menendez', 'egyptian', 'official', 'official', 'press', 'menendez', 'status', 'military', 'aid', 'in', 'exchange', 'hana', 'put', 'nadine', 'menendez', 'company', 'payroll', 'prosecutor', 'time', 'one', 'large', 'recipient', 'military', 'aid', 'state', 'department', 'withhold', 'million', 'cancel', 'additional', 'million', 'country', 'could', 'demonstrate', 'improvement', 'human', 'right', 'meeting', 'tell', 'hana', 'information', 'status', 'aid', 'prosecutor', 'say', 'hana', 'texted', 'egyptian', 'official', 'the', 'ban', 'small', 'arm', 'ammunition', 'egypt', 'lift', 'accord', 'indictment', 'make', 'public', 'say', 'egypt', 'government', 'grant', 'one', 'hana', 'company', 'exclusive', 'license', 'export', 'halal', 'food', 'united', 'state', 'egypt', 'despite', 'lack', 'experience', 'halal', 'certification', 'hana', 'use', 'proceeds', 'export', 'fund', 'bribe', 'payment', 'accord', 'egyptian', 'embassy', 'washington', 'immediately', 'respond', 'request', 'williams', 'top', 'federal', 'prosecutor', 'manhattan', 'set', 'address', 'charge', 'edt', 'gmt', 'press', 'previously', 'charge', 'new', 'jersey', 'accept', 'private', 'flight', 'campaign', 'contribution', 'bribe', 'wealthy', 'patron', 'exchange', 'official', 'favor', 'trial', 'end', 'jury', 'drop', 'bribery', 'case', 'menendez', 'maintain', 'later', 'year', 'third', 'term', 'senate', 'first', 'join']"
103,"Trump, New York attorney general to argue over scope of looming fraud trial | Reuters",2023-09-22 06:20:00-04:00,") - Donald Trump's lawyers on Friday will try to persuade a New York judge to throw out, just 10 days before a scheduled trial, most or all of state Attorney General Letitia James's lawsuit accusing the former U.S. president of ""staggering"" fraud.Lawyers for James, in contrast, will ask the same Manhattan judge to find Trump and other defendants, including his adult sons and his Trump Organization family business, liable for fraud even before a jury starts hearing evidence.The looming trial comes as Trump enjoys a dominating lead in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, despite facing a slew of litigation including four criminal indictments where he has pleaded not guilty.Justice Arthur Engoron is reviewing James' claims that Trump repeatedly lied in financial statements to obtain better terms on loans and insurance.James has accused Trump of overstating the values of more than 20 properties from 2011 to 2021, including his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and Trump Tower penthouse in Manhattan, and inflating his own fortune by as much as $3.6 billion.""Based on the undisputed evidence, no trial is required for the court to determine that defendants presented grossly and materially inflated asset values,"" and used them to defraud banks and insurers, James has said.Trump has called the lawsuit a ""witch hunt.""His lawyers have argued that James has no authority to sue over private transactions they say were not fraudulent, and that most of her claims fall outside statutes of limitations.They cited a June decision by a state appeals court dismissing claims against Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, and various other claims predating July 2014 or February 2016.The court left it to Engoron to determine which parts could proceed.Last week, Trump accused James of ignoring the decision and Engoron of refusing to implement it, and said the trial should be delayed.That prompted an appeals court judge on Sept. 14 to temporarily stay the trial. A five-judge panel is expected to decide next week whether the trial should proceed.Engoron has chosen not to appear before the panel, and referred it to his prior orders.On Thursday, James called Trump's request for a delay a ""brazen and meritless"" attempt to undermine Engoron's authority.She said even a brief delay ""would likely wreak havoc"" on the trial and other trials that Trump faces.James' lawsuit seeks to bar Trump and his adult sons Donald Jr. And Eric from running businesses in New York.

104,US government shutdown could slow House Republicans' Biden impeachment inquiry | Reuters,2023-09-22 09:23:00-04:00,") - The looming U.S. government shutdown that some hardline Republicans, including Donald Trump, are cheering for could slow one of their other priorities: the recently launched impeachment inquiry of Democratic President Joe Biden.Republican House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy launched the inquiry on Sept. 12, an escalation after months of probes into Biden's son, Hunter Biden, with the first hearing set for Sept. 28 -- just two days before the shutdown deadline.Most congressional staffers are expected to remain at work if the government partially shuts down after Sept. 30, when funding runs out -- that's in part because only Congress has the authority to pass legislation to fund and re-open the government.But the White House plays by different rules and will likely send home as many employees as possible in a bid to heighten pressure on Congress to act -- and that could include staff who would respond to requests for information, lawmakers said.That's a possibility McCarthy had warned about in August, when he was still trying to persuade his caucus not to move ahead with an immediate impeachment inquiry.""If we shut down, all of government shuts it down, investigation and everything else,"" McCarthy said in an interview with Fox News. A spokesperson for the speaker did not respond to a request for comment.In a 2018-2019 shutdown, the White House furloughed 1,100 of 1,800 staff in the Executive Office of the President.The impeachment inquiry is focused on Biden's son Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings. House Republicans alleged that the elder Biden benefited from his son's work but have produced no evidence of that. The White House says President Biden has done nothing wrong and that Republicans have no basis for the inquiry.""They should answer for their own backwards priorities that are hurting the American people so they can play politics,"" said Ian Sams, a White House spokesman.House Republicans say they plan to seek personal and business records for Hunter Biden and James Biden, the president's brother, and to seek testimony from certain officials.""Whether the government gets shut down or not, we're going to continue to do our work, whether it's individually or as a committee as a whole,"" said Troy Nehls, a Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, one of the three panels at the center of the inquiry.Multiple Republican lawmakers said they thought a shutdown could slow the probe.""There's no question at all that the administration will not answer any questions and use a shutdown as an excuse to say they sent home the people who would answer,"" said Darrell Issa, a member of the House Judiciary Committee and a former chairman of the Oversight panel. ""So can we ask the questions? Yes. Are they going to deliver witnesses that they have control over, or answers?

106,"US presidential election 2024: Dates, candidates and latest issues | Reuters",2023-09-22 10:30:00-04:00,") - The 2024 presidential election promises to be like no other modern U.S. election.Leading the field of Republican presidential candidates is former President Donald Trump, who faces a battery of federal and state criminal charges related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.If Trump captures the Republican nomination and wins the general election, he will become the first president in 130 years to win the White House after sitting out a term, after Grover Cleveland.Biden, the incumbent president, is the presumptive Democratic nominee. He will be 81 when the election is held in November 2024, making him the oldest American ever to win a presidential election should he secure a second term.Trump, 77, is dominating a field of 10 major candidates who have largely avoided criticizing him directly for fear of alienating his base of diehard supporters.His Republican rivals, such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, instead have argued that Trump’s legal woes will hamstring him in a general-election fight against Biden.Two notable exceptions are Trump’s former vice president, Mike Pence, and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who have both been critical of Trump’s attempts to subvert the 2020 election outcome.Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a newcomer to politics, is running as an inheritor of Trump’s populist, America First agenda, one that is wary of an expansive federal government, corporate power and international alliances.DeSantis was once viewed as the most likely candidate to deny Trump the nomination, but his campaign has sputtered since launching in May despite having a big war chest. He risks falling into the rest of the pack behind Trump.Polls show that Trump is largely tied with Biden in head-to-head matchups, with voters concerned about Biden's age and his handling of the economy despite job growth, infrastructure investment and a slow easing of inflation after last year's peak.Trump faces indictments in four cases in federal and state courts for his efforts to undermine the 2020 election, his mishandling of classified documents and his involvement in a “hush money” scheme involving a porn star. He has maintained his innocence and argued that he is the victim of politically motivated prosecutions, an assertion the Biden administration denies. The legal calendars for those cases pose obstacles for Trump's ability to campaign.While voters may not be enthusiastic, Democratic leaders are backing Biden and his vice president, Kamala Harris.Robert F. Kennedy Jr., scion of the storied political family, who has pushed anti-vaccine and anti-COVID-19 safety views, is a long-shot challenger, as is 2020 candidate Marianne Williamson, a self-help author and speaker.Biden's pitch for a second four-year term rests on his stewardship of the economy as it has emerged from the COVID pandemic, and what he calls the ""battle for the soul of America,"" a fight against Trump-aligned Republicans.Under Biden, unemployment dropped to generational lows, gross domestic product (GDP) grew faster than expected and wages have risen. However, inflation spiked last year, and, while it has eased in recent months, voters remain concerned about the high price of staples such as food, fuel, cars and housing.Should Trump be the Republican nominee, much of Biden's campaign is likely to focus on warning voters that Trump poses a mortal threat to American democracy, and that he will undermine U.S. foreign policy interests, and push through new tax cuts for the rich and for companies.The lack of enthusiasm among voters for a Biden-Trump rematch suggests a third-party challenger could garner some support or push more Americans to sit out the election after 2020's 66.8% voter turnout marked the highest level for a U.S. presidential election this century. A significant third-party candidate has yet to emerge, however.Republicans will hold their first nominating contest in January with the Iowa caucuses. New Hampshire will hold a more traditional presidential primary shortly thereafter, followed by Nevada, South Carolina and Michigan.Democrats plan to hold their first primary in South Carolina in February, with Biden not expected to face a serious challenger. ""Super Tuesday"" - when more than a dozen states will award delegates to the party conventions, including California and Texas - will be on March 5.Each party will nominate the candidate who receives the most delegates at their nominating conventions in the summer of 2024. Republicans will hold their convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, while Democrats will stage theirs in Chicago.The general election will be held on Nov. 5, 2024.Abortion: Democrats plan to make abortion central to their 2024 campaign, with public opinion polls showing most Americans don’t favor strict limits on reproductive rights. The issue has become more motivating to those who support abortion rights than to those who oppose them, and the party is hoping threats to those rights will encourage millions of women and independents to vote their way next year.The issue has divided Republicans, with some leaders concerned the party has gone too far with state-level restrictions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling last year, ending constitutional protection for abortion.Republican presidential candidates are split between those saying abortion laws should be left to the states and those supporting a national ban.The Economy: Biden’s White House is trying to reassure Americans that the economy is in solid shape, with inflation slowing and unemployment at its lowest levels in a half-century.Republicans say they will cut federal spending, which they blame for stoking inflation and triggering consumer-price spikes, trim back federal regulations and lower taxes.Democrats argue the economy is healthy, wages are up and investments in infrastructure are producing long-term job gains.Voters remain unconvinced.  According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in August, 42% percent of Biden's 2020 voters said the economy was ""worse"" than it was in 2020, compared with 33% who said it was ""better"" and 24% who said it was ""about the same.""Immigration: Since taking office in 2021, Biden has grappled with record numbers of migrants caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, straining resources there and cities they have gone to, such as New York and Chicago. Republican candidates, including Trump, have blamed Biden for reversing more restrictive Trump-era policies and have pledged to step up border security. Some Democrats have criticized Biden for turning to Trump-style enforcement measures to reduce illegal crossings, while the White House maintains it is moving to a more humane and orderly system by offering new ways for migrants to enter legally.Crime: Violent crime remains at higher levels across the nation than in 2019, the year before the COVID pandemic and unrest over racial justice. Americans of both parties are concerned, with 88% of respondents in a September Reuters/Ipsos poll saying crime would be an important issue for determining who gets their vote.Foreign Policy: China has emerged as the foreign policy issue in the campaign, with Republicans arguing the Asian power is a growing threat to national security, U.S. corporate interests and Taiwan's independence.The Biden administration has said it wants to ""de-risk"" and not ""de-couple"" its relationship with China and work to keep the competition between the world's No. 1 and No. 2 economic powers from escalating into conflict.Ukraine is another major issue, and has split the Republican field. Trump and DeSantis argue that Biden's support of Ukraine in its war with Russia is distracting the U.S. from preparing for a possible confrontation with China. Other Republican candidates, such as Pence and Haley, say the United States must continue to back Ukraine.Biden, who has focused on rebuilding relations with allies after Trump's presidency, has helped build an international coalition to help Ukraine fight Russia, and will likely highlight the importance of maintaining that policy on the campaign trail.That both parties are holding their conventions in the Midwest says much about the value they are placing on Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which went for Trump in 2016 and flipped to Biden in 2020.Arizona, Georgia and Nevada have also proven to be closely divided and contain growing populations that could determine the next election. Another key battleground next year could be North Carolina, another Southern state with an increasingly diverse electorate.",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-2024/us-presidential-election-2024-dates-candidates-and-latest-issues-idUSKBN30S16T,reuters,2023-09-22,"['u', 'presidential', 'election',

107,"US pledges new aid for Haiti, urges U.N. to authorize security mission | Reuters",2023-09-22 10:21:00-04:00,") - The United States on Friday unveiled $65 million more in help for Haiti's police and urged the U.N. Security Council to formally back the deployment of a multinational security mission to help the Caribbean country battle crippling gang violence.Speaking at a meeting in New York to address the security situation in Haiti, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the mission, led by Kenya, could deploy ""within months.""""We really have no time to lose,"" Blinken said.Haiti last year asked for help to combat violent gangs that have largely overrun the capital Port-au-Prince. The council could vote as soon as next week, diplomats said, on a U.S.-drafted resolution supporting a multinational police deployment.While not providing any troops, Blinken said the Biden administration will work with the U.S. Congress to provide $100 million to back the multinational mission with logistical and financial assistance. This could include intelligence support, airlift, communications and medical support, he said.The $65 million announced on Friday will aim to bolster the Haitian police capacity to dismantle the gangs, Blinken said.Washington supports Kenya's vision for a three-part security mission that includes helping Haitian police, ensuring security for static installations and thoroughfares and strengthening law enforcement in the long term, Blinken said.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a report to the council last month that a ""robust use of force"" by a multinational police deployment and the use of military assets were needed to restore law and order in Haiti and disarm gangs.A multinational police deployment would not be a U.N. mission.The United States was also imposing new visa bans on former and current Haitian officials whom Blinken said were enabling the violence.",https://www.reuters.com/article/haiti-violence/us-pledges-new-aid-for-haiti-urges-u-n-to-authorize-security-mission-idUSKBN30S189,reuters,2023-09-22,"['u', 'pledge', 'new', 'aid', 'haiti', 'urge', 'authorize', 'security', 'mission', 'reuters', 'the', 'united', 'state', 'friday', 'unveil', 'million', 'help', 'haiti', 'police', 'urge', 'security', 'council', 'formally', 'back', 'deployment', 'multinational', 'security', 'mission', 'help', 'caribbean', 'country', 'battle', 'cripple', 'gang', 'meet', 'new', 'york', 'address', 'security', 'situation', 'haiti', 'secretary', 'state', 'antony', 'blinken', 'say', 'mission', 'lead', 'kenya', 'could', 'deploy', 'within', 'month', 'we', 'really', 'time', 'lose', 'blinken', 'last', 'year', 'ask', 'help', 'combat', 'violent', 'gang', 'largely', 'overrun', 'capital', 'the', 'council', 'could', 'vote', 'soon', 'next', 'week', 'diplomat', 'say', 'resolution', 'support', 'multinational', 'police', 'provide', 'troop', 'blinken', 'say', 'biden', 'administration', 'work', 'congress', 'provide', 'million', 'back', 'multinational', 'mission', 'logistical', 'financial', 'assistance', 'this', 'could', 'include', 'intelligence', 'support', 'airlift', 'communication', 'medical', 'support', 'million', 'announce', 'friday', 'aim', 'bolster', 'haitian', 'police', 'capacity', 'dismantle', 'gang', 'blinken', 'support', 'kenya', 'vision', 'security', 'mission', 'include', 'help', 'haitian', 'police', 'ensure', 'security', 'static', 'installation', 'thoroughfares', 'strengthen', 'law', 'enforcement', 'long', 'term', 'blinken', 'antonio', 'guterres', 'say', 'report', 'council', 'last', 'month', 'robust', 'use', 'force', 'multinational', 'police', 'deployment', 'use', 'military', 'asset', 'need', 'restore', 'law', 'order', 'haiti', 'disarm', 'multinational', 'police', 'deployment', 'would', 'united', 'state', 'also', 'impose', 'new', 'visa', 'ban', 'former', 'current', 'haitian', 'official', 'blinken', 'say', 'enable', 'violence']"

from multi-year highs, while shares of Ford jumped on news of progress in labor talks with workers' union.Ford Motor (F.N) advanced 2.5% after Reuters reported the United Auto Workers (UAW) was set to announce progress in labor contract talks with the carmaker.Consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD), which houses the automaker, added 0.4%.U.S. Treasury yields pulled back after surging to fresh highs on

109,"U.S. business activity nears stand-still in September, survey says | Reuters",2023-09-22 10:00:00-04:00,") - U.S. business activity showed little change in September, with the vast services sector essentially idling at the slowest pace since February, and overall new order activity slipping to the lowest level this year, a survey published Friday showed.S&P Global said its flash U.S. Composite PMI index, which tracks the manufacturing and service sectors, dipped to a reading of 50.1 in September from a final reading for August of 50.2. September's result was negligibly above the 50 level that separates expansion and contraction.The survey's composite new orders index slid to the lowest since December at 47.7 from 49.2 last month, marking the second straight month of declining new business. Input cost pressures ticked higher for a second month as well.The U.S. economy so far this year has defied projections for sliding into a recession that most economists had expected would be triggered by the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate increases aimed at quelling inflation. Job growth and consumer spending have all held up, and the pace of inflation has slowed markedly, leading Fed officials on Wednesday to upgrade their economic forecasts to a degree that suggests many of them now believe a recession may be averted altogether.At the same time, the Fed left interest rates unchanged but indicated borrowing costs will remain high well into next year, which could hamper the economy's progress from here. Indeed, a range of indicators in the last month have signaled momentum is slowing, and Friday's PMI figures buttressed that view.""PMI data for September added to concerns regarding the trajectory of demand conditions in the U.S. economy following interest rate hikes and elevated inflation,"" Siân Jones, Principal Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in a statement.The survey's services PMI edged down to an eight-month low of 50.2, fractionally lower than the reading of 50.6 expected by economists in a Reuters poll. S&P's manufacturing PMI ticked higher to 48.9 from 47.9 in August but was still the fifth straight month of contraction. Economists had forecast a manufacturing PMI of 48.0.Despite the softening environment, both manufacturing and services survey respondents indicated companies kept adding to staff levels this month. Overall employment growth was the strongest in four months, led by the services sector, but that may prove difficult to replicate in the months ahead.""Subdued demand did not translate into overall job losses in September as a greater ability to find and retain employees led to a quicker rise in employment growth,"" Jones said. ""That said, the boost to hiring from rising candidate availability may not be sustained amid evidence of burgeoning spare capacity and dwindling backlogs which have previously supported workloads.""",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-pmi-flash/u-s-business-activity-nears-stand-still-in-september-survey-says-idUSKBN30S16R,reuters,2023-09-22,"['business', 'activity', 'near', 'september', 'survey', 'say', 'reuters', 'business', 'activity', 'show', 'little', 'change', 'september', 'vast', 'service', 'sector', 'essentially', 'idle', 'slow', 'pace', 'since', 'february', 'overall', 'new', 'order', 'activity', 'slip', 'low', 'level', 'year', 'survey', 'publish', 'friday', 'p', 'global', 'say', 'flash', 'composite', 'pmi', 'index', 'track', 'manufacture', 'service', 'sector', 'dip', 'read', 'september', 'final', 'reading', 'august', 'september', 'result', 'negligibly', 'level', 'separate', 'expansion', 'survey', 'composite', 'new', 'order', 'index', 'slide', 'low', 'since', 'december', 'last', 'month', 'mark', 'second', 'straight', 'month', 'decline', 'new', 'business', 'input', 'cost', 'pressure', 'tick', 'high', 'second', 'month', 'economy', 'far', 'year', 'defied', 'projection', 'slide', 'recession', 'economist', 'expect', 'would', 'trigger', 'federal', 'reserve', 'aggressive', 'interest', 'rate', 'increase', 'aim', 'quell', 'inflation', 'job', 'growth', 'consumer', 'spending', 'hold', 'pace', 'inflation', 'slow', 'markedly', 'leading', 'fed', 'official', 'wednesday', 'upgrade', 'economic', 'forecast', 'degree', 'suggest', 'many', 'believe', 'recession', 'may', 'avert', 'time', 'fed', 'leave', 'interest', 'rate', 'unchanged', 'indicated', 'borrowing', 'cost', 'remain', 'high', 'well', 'next', 'year', 'could', 'hamper', 'economy', 'progress', 'indeed', 'range', 'indicator', 'last', 'month', 'signal', 'momentum', 'slow', 'friday', 'pmi', 'figure', 'buttress', 'view', 'pmi', 'data', 'september', 'add', 'concern', 'regard', 'trajectory', 'demand', 'condition', 'economy', 'follow', 'interest', 'rate', 'hike', 'elevate', 'inflation', 'siân', 'jones', 'principal', 'economist', 's', 'p', 'global', 'market', 'intelligence', 'say', 'survey', 'service', 'pmi', 'edge', 'low', 'fractionally', 'low', 'reading', 'expect', 'economist', 'reuters', 'poll', 's', 'p', 'manufacturing', 'pmi', 'tick', 'high', 'august', 'still', 'fifth', 'straight', 'month', 'contraction', 'economist', 'forecast', 'manufacture', 'pmi', 'soften', 'environment', 'manufacturing', 'service', 'survey', 'respondent', 'indicate', 'company', 'keep', 'add', 'staff', 'level', 'month', 'overall', 'employment', 'growth', 'strong', 'four', 'month', 'lead', 'service', 'sector', 'may', 'prove', 'difficult', 'replicate', 'month', 'ahead', 'subdued', 'demand', 'translate', 'overall', 'job', 'loss', 'september', 'great', 'ability', 'find', 'retain', 'employee', 'lead', 'quick', 'rise', 'employment', 'growth', 'jones', 'say', 'that', 'say', 'boost', 'hiring', 'rise', 'candidate', 'availability', 'may', 'sustain', 'amid', 'evidence', 'burgeon', 'spare', 'capacity', 'dwindle', 'backlog', 'previously', 'support', 'workload']"
110,"Exclusive: UAW to strike more GM, Stellantis plants, has made progress with Ford | Reuters",2023-09-22 10:35:00-04:00,") - The United Auto Workers will expand its strikes against Detroit automakers General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (STLAM.MI), but has made real progress in talks with Ford Motor (F.N), the union said on Friday.The autoworkers' union will expand its strike against parts distribution centers across the United States at GM and Stellantis, extending its unprecedented, simultaneous strikes that began with one assembly plant each of the Detroit Three.UAW President Shawn Fain, in a Facebook live event, said by targeting distribution centers, this turns the strike into a nationwide event.""We will be everywhere from California to Massachusetts, from Oregon to Florida,"" said Fain.Fain said earlier this week further strikes could be avoided if companies showed ""significant progress"" toward an agreement.""Stellantis and GM in particular are going to need some serious pushing,"" said Fain. He said they have more work to do at Ford, but ""we do want to recognize that Ford is showing they're serious about reaching a deal.""The union will also invite President Joe Biden to come to the picket lines. The president has been vocal in his support for the union's demands for better pay and benefits.Ford shares gained 3.7% while GM shares were up 0.8%, the latter paring earlier gains following the news. GM did not immediately comment. Stellantis said the company is continuing to meet with the union.Ford said it is continuing to negotiate, adding that ""we have more work ahead of us before we can reach an agreement.""The wider strike will not at this time include plants that build highly profitable pickup trucks like GM's Chevy Silverado and Stellantis' Ram.About 12,700 workers walked out at plants in Missouri, Michigan and Ohio on Sept 15. Those plants produce the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, alongside other popular models.Responding to the news of progress at Ford, Arthur Wheaton, who teaches collective bargaining at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said ""I'm not surprised and that is primarily because Ford has a long history of stronger labor relations.""The standoff is fueling worries about prolonged industrial action that could disrupt production and ripple through the supply chain and dent U.S. economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday shows significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers.The strike has become a focus of attention for Biden and Republican candidates who want to replace him. An invitation by the UAW to Biden would be a notable overture by the union to the White House, which it has held at arm's length until now.White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre was asked Thursday if Biden plans to visit a picket line. She declined to answer but said ""all parties continuing to be at the negotiating table is a positive. It is important that we result in a win-win agreement.""The White House did not immediately comment on Friday.Fain has said the Detroit automakers have not shared their huge profits with workers while enriching executives and investors.GM President Mark Reuss this week rejected those claims, saying the current offer to the union would be generous and the company's profits have been reinvested in the transition to electric vehicles.The automakers have proposed 20% raises over 4-1/2 years, while the UAW is seeking 40%.The union also wants to end a tiered wage structure that it says has created a large gap between newer and older employees.S&P said the strikes, which began on Sept. 15, were highly likely to last several weeks, potentially cutting third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product by 0.4% and causing ""upheaval"" across global automotive supply chains.GM, Ford and Stellantis have said they are making contingency plans for further U.S. work stoppages.Ford reached a last-minute deal to avoid a walkout at its Canadian operations late on Tuesday. Unifor, which represents about 5,600 Canadian auto workers, had been threatening to go on strike at all three Ford plants in the country.",https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-labor-uaw/uaw-to-strike-more-gm-stellantis-facilities-has-made-progress-with-ford-idUSKBN30S08K,reuters,2023-09-22,"['exclusive', 'uaw', 'strike', 'gm', 'stellantis', 'plant', 'make', 'progress', 'ford', 'reuters', 'the', 'united', 'auto', 'worker', 'expand', 'strike', 'detroit', 'automakers', 'general', 'motor', 'chrysler', 'parent', 'stellantis', 'make', 'real', 'progress', 'talk', 'ford', 'motor', 'union', 'say', 'autoworkers', 'union', 'expand', 'strike', 'part', 'distribution', 'center', 'across', 'united', 'state', 'gm', 'stellantis', 'extend', 'unprecedented', 'simultaneous', 'strike', 'begin', 'one', 'assembly', 'plant', 'detroit', 'president', 'shawn', 'fain', 'facebook', 'live', 'event', 'say', 'target', 'distribution', 'center', 'turn', 'strike', 'nationwide', 'event', 'we', 'everywhere', 'california', 'massachusetts', 'oregon', 'florida', 'say', 'say', 'earlier', 'week', 'strike', 'could', 'avoid', 'company', 'show', 'significant', 'progress', 'toward', 'agreement', 'stellantis', 'gm', 'particular', 'go', 'need', 'serious', 'push', 'say', 'fain', 'he', 'say', 'work', 'ford', 'want', 'recognize', 'ford', 'show', 'serious', 'reach', 'deal', 'the', 'union', 'also', 'invite', 'president', 'joe', 'biden', 'come', 'picket', 'line', 'the', 'president', 'vocal', 'support', 'union', 'demand', 'well', 'pay', 'share', 'gain', 'gm', 'share', 'latter', 'par', 'earlier', 'gain', 'follow', 'news', 'gm', 'immediately', 'comment', 'stellantis', 'say', 'company', 'continue', 'meet', 'say', 'continue', 'negotiate', 'add', 'work', 'ahead', 'u', 'reach', 'agreement', 'the', 'wider', 'strike', 'time', 'include', 'plant', 'build', 'highly', 'profitable', 'pickup', 'truck', 'like', 'gm', 'chevy', 'silverado', 'stellantis', 'worker', 'walk', 'plant', 'missouri', 'michigan', 'ohio', 'sept', 'those', 'plant', 'produce', 'ford', 'bronco', 'jeep', 'wrangler', 'chevrolet', 'colorado', 'alongside', 'popular', 'news', 'progress', 'ford', 'arthur', 'wheaton', 'teach', 'collective', 'bargaining', 'cornell', 'school', 'industrial', 'labor', 'relation', 'say', 'i', 'surprise', 'primarily', 'ford', 'long', 'history', 'strong', 'labor', 'relation', 'the', 'standoff', 'fuel', 'worry', 'prolong', 'industrial', 'action', 'could', 'disrupt', 'production', 'ripple', 'supply', 'chain', 'dent', 'economic', 'growth', 'a', 'poll', 'release', 'thursday', 'show', 'significant', 'support', 'american', 'striking', 'auto', 'strike', 'become', 'focus', 'attention', 'biden', 'republican', 'candidate', 'want', 'replace', 'an', 'invitation', 'uaw', 'biden', 'would', 'notable', 'overture', 'union', 'white', 'house', 'hold', 'arm', 'length', 'house', 'spokeswoman', 'karine', 'ask', 'thursday', 'biden', 'plan', 'visit', 'picket', 'line', 'she', 'decline', 'answer', 'say', 'party', 'continue', 'negotiate', 'table', 'positive', 'it', 'important', 'result', 'agreement', 'the', 'white', 'house', 'immediately', 'comment', 'say', 'detroit', 'automaker', 'share', 'huge', 'profit', 'worker', 'enrich', 'executive', 'president', 'mark', 'reuss', 'week', 'reject', 'claim', 'say', 'current', 'offer', 'union', 'would', 'generous', 'company', 'profit', 'reinvested', 'transition', 'electric', 'automaker', 'propose', 'raise', 'year', 'uaw', 'seek', 'union', 'also', 'want', 'end', 'tiered', 'wage', 'structure', 'say', 'create', 'large', 'gap', 'newer', 'old', 'p', 'say', 'strike', 'begin', 'highly', 'likely', 'last', 'several', 'week', 'potentially', 'cut', 'gross', 'domestic', 'product', 'cause', 'upheaval', 'across', 'global', 'automotive', 'supply', 'ford', 'stellantis', 'say', 'make', 'contingency', 'plan', 'work', 'reach', 'deal', 'avoid', 'walkout', 'canadian', 'operation', 'late', 'tuesday', 'unifor', 'represent', 'canadian', 'auto', 'worker', 'threaten', 'go', 'strike', 'three', 'ford', 'plant', 'country']"
111,"Ukraine's Zelenskiy visits close ally Canada, Trudeau after challenging US trip | Reuters",2023-09-22 10:13:00-04:00,") - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Friday makes his first visit to close ally Canada, where he is guaranteed a warmer welcome than he received from some U.S. politicians skeptical about providing more military aid.Canada is one of Kyiv's staunchest supporters in its war with Russia, and is set to announce during the visit that it is sending more weapons to Ukraine, according to a government official.""Canada remains unwavering in our support to the people of Ukraine as they fight for their sovereignty and their democracy, as well as our shared values like respect for the rule of law, freedom, and self-determination,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement late on Thursday.Zelenskiy is due to address parliament in Ottawa at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT) and then hold a news conference with Trudeau at 2:45 pm ET (1845 GMT) before flying to Toronto to meet business leaders and then address a rally.The Ukrainian leader said he would be talking to Trudeau about defense cooperation, and would sign treaties to strengthen economic ties.""I am certain this will be a meaningful visit. We are grateful to Canada for its principled leadership and support,"" Zelenskiy said in a post on messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter.Dozens of extra police were on duty on Friday in central Ottawa, and roads leading to Parliament Hill were blocked off.The Communications Security Establishment, Canada's signals intelligence agency, warned the cybersecurity community against malicious threats.""It's not uncommon to see increased distributed denial-of-service campaigns against NATO countries that support Ukraine, or host visits from Ukrainian government officials,"" it said in a statement.There are 1.4 million people of Ukrainian descent in Canada, the third most after Ukraine and Russia.Ihor Michalchyshyn, executive director of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress lobby group, said Canada was influential given its membership in both the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and NATO and noted all Canadian political parties support Ukraine.""So I think it's appropriate for the president to be expecting and asking more from his Canadian partners,"" Michalchyshyn said in an interview. ""If friends of Ukraine want Ukraine to win the war, then the only way that happens is with renewed and more military support.""In Washington, Zelenskiy appealed to U.S. lawmakers on Thursday for continued support amid doubts by some Republicans over whether Congress should approve a new round of aid.Although there are no such divisions in Canada, it does not have the deep pockets or military reserves of the United States, Germany and other major backers.Since the beginning of 2022, Canada has committed over C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) in aid to Ukraine, including over C$1.8 billion in military assistance.The Canadian government official said the arms deal Trudeau was likely to announce on Friday would be bigger than the C$33 million Ottawa unveiled on Sunday to help Kyiv buy missile defenses.

112,Analysis: Questions about Russia's clout in ex-USSR grow after Karabakh crisis | Reuters,2023-09-22 10:24:00-04:00,") - Russian foreign policy hawks savoured chaotic scenes at Kabul airport when U.S. forces quit Afghanistan two years ago. Images of fleeing Armenians at Russia's own peacekeeping base at an airport in Nagorno-Karabakh have been harder for them to watch.Just as Washington's retreat prompted some Americans to fret over U.S. power and emboldened its foes, the apparent impotence of Russian peacekeepers stationed in Karabakh to prevent Turkish-backed Azerbaijani forces from sweeping in to seize the area by force is awkward for Moscow.Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave internationally recognised as Azerbaijan but run by a breakaway administration since a war in the early 1990s, is in a corner of the former Soviet Union that Moscow views as its own backyard but where its influence is under pressure from Turkey, Azerbaijan and Iran at a time when it is distracted by its own war in Ukraine.Russia, which has military facilities, including an airbase, in Armenia, has signalled it has no intention of withdrawing its forces from the South Caucasus, a region crisscrossed with oil and gas pipelines.But its handling of the Karabakh crisis has forced it into a blame game with Armenia and obliged it to defend its foreign policy in the region.Hundreds are believed to have been killed in Karabakh in recent days where over 100,000 ethnic Armenian civilians will now have to choose between exile from what they view as their historical homeland or integration into what many of them see as a hostile state despite Azerbaijani assurances.""The dramatic photos of many frightened people at Stepanakert airport (in Karabakh) are an obvious visual rhyme with the photos of crowds at Kabul airport in 2021,"" said Alexander Baunov, a former Russian diplomat who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie think-tank.""Moscow concluded from the Kabul pictures that America was weak and that the historical chance to deal with Ukraine had come. Who will draw what conclusions from the Karabakh pictures?""The anger felt by some Russians over what they view as their declining influence in the South Caucasus was amplified by the killing of five Russian peacekeepers in an apparent accident involving Azerbaijani forces.Photographs of the incident's aftermath posted on social media showed the rear windscreen of the vehicle which the Russian soldiers were travelling in riddled with bullet holes.""Azerbaijan defeated Karabakh with a clear taste of Russian blood on its lips,"" wrote Zhivov Z, one of many Russian military bloggers who have come to prominence as commentators on the Ukraine war.""All those who are now dancing around the Azerbaijani victory - you are dancing on the bodies of Russian officers,"" he wrote, calling, along with other bloggers, for Moscow to retaliate against Baku.An outbreak of anti-Russian feeling in Armenia, traditionally one of Russia's closest allies, has made the situation more difficult for Moscow, whose resources and attention are stretched by the war in Ukraine.Protesters who say they feel betrayed by Russia's failure to stop Azerbaijan have gathered outside the Russian embassy in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, and chanted anti-Russian slogans.""This is a dangerous tendency,"" said Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser. ""Anti-Russian hysteria is being stoked.""Nikol Pashinyan, Armenia's prime minister, angered Moscow in the run-up to the crisis by saying it had been a mistake to rely solely on Russia to protect his country's security.Accusing the roughly 2,000 Russian peacekeepers in Karabakh of failing to do their job, he then pointedly held joint military drills with U.S. forces while promising to diversify Yerevan's security partners.Russia has responded with a damage limitation exercise, blaming the debacle squarely on Pashinyan and accusing him of diplomatic incompetence and ingratitude.Pashinyan, who came to power on the back of street protests in 2018 that diluted Russian influence, has long been seen by Moscow as too pro-Western. It now accuses him of triggering the crisis by saying - after Russian peacekeepers were deployed to Karabakh in 2020 following Armenia's defeat in a 44-day war - that he recognised Azerbaijan's territorial integrity.Baku has long argued that Karabakh falls within its own borders, but Karabakh Armenians wanted Pashinyan to recognise their independence and unify them with Armenia.Some Russian officials such as Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Security Council, have signalled they would be happy to see Pashinyan - who is now facing calls from his rivals to resign - toppled.""Guess what fate awaits him?"" Medvedev wrote on Tuesday, the day that Azerbaijan sent its forces into Karabakh, after publishing a list of what he saw as Pashinyan's mistakes, including ""flirting with NATO"".Russia may be on the backfoot but it believes Armenia's room for manoeuvre is limited, whoever is in charge.Margarita Simonyan, one of Russia's most powerful state media managers and herself of Armenian descent, said Moscow should not have to explain its actions in Karabakh to Pashinyan, whom she accused of selling out his own people.""Russia can get by without Armenia,"" she wrote.

113,Taiwan expects to deploy two new submarines by 2027 -security adviser ,2023-09-24 16:03:00-04:00,") - Taiwan hopes to deploy at least two new, domestically developed submarines by 2027, and possibly equip later models with missiles, to strengthen deterrence against the Chinese navy and protect key supply lines, the head of the program said.Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has made the indigenous sub program a key part of an ambitious project to modernise its armed forces as Beijing stages almost daily military exercises to assert its sovereignty.President Tsai Ing-wen, who initiated the program when she took office in 2016, is expected to launch the first of eight new submarines on Thursday under a plan that has drawn on expertise and technology from several countries - a breakthrough for diplomatically isolated Taiwan.Admiral Huang Shu-kuang, Tsai's security adviser, who is leading the program, said a fleet of 10 submarines - which includes two Dutch-made submarines commissioned in the 1980s - will make it harder for the Chinese navy to project power into the Pacific.""If we can build up this combat capacity, I don't think we will lose a war,"" Huang this month told an internal briefing on the project, which was attended by Reuters.Huang said the first submarine, with a price tag of T$49.36 billion ($1.54 billion), will use a combat system by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and carry U.S.-made MK-48 heavyweight torpedoes. It will enter sea trials next month before delivery to the navy by the end of 2024.For subsequent models, Taiwan will leave space for submarine-launched anti-ship missiles, but adding those weapons depends on production availability in a U.S., where capacity was already tight, Huang said, without naming the companies that might be involved.He called the submarines a ""strategic deterrent"" to Chinese warships crossing the Miyako Strait near southwestern Japan or the Bashi Channel that separates Taiwan from the Philippines.Huang said Taiwan's diesel-electric submarines can keep China at bay within the first island chain, referring to the area that runs from Japan through Taiwan, the Philippines and on to Borneo, enclosing China's coastal seas.""This was also the strategic concept of the U.S. military - to contain them within the first island chain and deny their access,"" Huang said. ""If Taiwan is taken, Japan will definitely not be safe, South Korea will definitely not be safe.""China's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment.The Chinese navy, including its Shandong aircraft carrier, has become increasingly active in recent months off Taiwan's eastern coastline, prompting worries that China could launch an attack from that direction. Eastern Taiwan is where planners have long envisioned the island's military regrouping and preserving its forces during a conflict.Huang said the submarines can help maintain the island's ""lifeline"" to the Pacific by keeping ports along Taiwan's eastern coast open for supplies in a conflict.""The submarines will keep their ships away from our eastern shores,"" he said.Chieh Chung, a military researcher at Taiwan's National Policy Foundation think tank, said the fleet would have trouble with that task, because China could position warships in the Pacific before launching an attack.But he added that the submarines could occupy strategic ambush points in the region and ""greatly harm (China's) combat ability"" by targeting high-value ships such as carrier groups or landing fleets.'GREAT HELP'Taiwan has quietly sourced technology, components and talent from at least seven nations to help it build submarines, a Reuters investigation has found. Getting foreign assistance was particularly challenging for Taiwan, which doesn't have official ties with most countries.Huang declined to say which countries had approved export permits, but said he had reached out to generals from countries that included the United States, Japan, South Korea and India.""For those foreign generals who agreed with my ideas, they helped convey the message to their governments or arrange meetings,"" he said. ""I told them our needs and that's how we achieved our purpose of securing export permits.""Huang also expressed thanks for the ""great help"" from a team led by an unnamed retired rear admiral of Britain's Royal Navy, who secured export permits from Britain through a Gibraltar-based company.Britain sharply increased the amount of submarine parts and technology exports approved last year for Taiwan, a Reuters analysis of the data showed. Huang described the program as ""even harder than reaching the sky,"" pointing to challenges such as a global chip shortage that hit many manufacturers around the world. He said his team scrambled to source chips from Taiwan to avoid delays by foreign vendors.A foreign supplier had also pull out at the last minute after the work with Taiwan was leaked to a Chinese embassy, he said, without elaborating.He said China's frequent military harassment, including close approaches to Taiwan's territorial waters and airspace, has prompted Taiwan and the United States to rethink the island's ""asymmetrical"" strategy of making its forces more mobile and harder to attack, with a focus on smaller weapons systems.""The American thinking is changing gradually. They realised that you can't withstand (the harassment) without bigger boats,"" Huang said, pointing to the navy's plan to build a new generation of bigger frigates.""They are getting closer and closer,"" he added, referring to China. ""Taiwan can't drive them out with small boats. We must use bigger boats.""($1 = 31.9840 Taiwan dollars)

114,Renault to maintain mixed ethanol combustion engines in Brazil ,2023-09-22 13:30:00-04:00,") -  Renault  (EPA:RENA) will maintain production of ethanol-fueled combustion vehicles in Brazil, where nine in 10 cars are equipped to run on a mixture of gasoline and the biofuel as fully electric vehicles (EVs) need more government support, the head of the French carmaker's Brazil branch said on Friday.""It still pays to invest in combustion in Brazil,"" top executive Ricardo Gondo said at an event, adding that the industry will need more federal incentives to accelerate its EV transition.Renault is wrapping up a $2 billion reais (over $400 million) investment in the country which includes a new vehicle platform to be produced in its Parana state industrial complex, that would allow the company to produce combustion engines in the facilities and ""allow electrification"", Gondo said.Renault did not say when it plans to manufacture electric cars in Brazil, and the only one it sells in the country - its China-made Kwid model, which according to the country's EV trade association, sold only two vehicles last month.Renault is planning to launch Brazilian sales of an electric version of its French-made Kangoo van in October, when it will also launch its Kardian combustion engine SUV, set to be manufactured locally.While Gondo defended Renault's plans for a ""transition period"" for electrification in Brazil, rivals such as Chinese automakers BYD (SZ:002594), Great Wall Motor Co Ltd, Chery and JAC are disrupting traditional local manufactures with fully electric models sold in Brazil. ""The combustion engine will continue to see improvements in energy efficiency,"" Gondo said, adding that the government should adopt quotas for electric cars tax-free imports to protect local manufacturers that face highly equipped products imported from China that have competitive prices.Earlier this month, Renault CEO Luca de Meo warned a ""very competitive"" industry in China and that it will need to ""catch up fast"". The company is planning to spin-off its EV unit together with partners Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Nissan (OTC:NSANY).Meanwhile, the government of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has placed an emphasis on fighting climate change and reversing policies enacted by his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.($1 = 4.9256 reais)

115,"Even China's 1.4 billion population can't fill all its vacant homes, former official says ",2023-09-23 03:38:00-04:00,") - Even China's population of 1.4 billion would not be enough to fill all the empty apartments littered across the country, a former official said on Saturday, in a rare public critique of the country's crisis-hit property market. China's property sector, once the pillar of the economy, has slumped since 2021 when real estate giant China  Evergrande  (HK:3333) Group defaulted on its debt obligations following a clampdown on new borrowing. Big-name developers such as Country Garden Holdings continue to teeter close to default even to this day, keeping home-buyer sentiment depressed.As of the end of August, the combined floor area of unsold homes stood at 648 million square metres (7 billion square feet), the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show. That would be equal to 7.2 million homes, according to Reuters calculations, based on the average home size of 90 square metres.That does not count the numerous residential projects that have already been sold but not yet completed due to cash-flow problems, or the multiple homes purchased by speculators in the last market upturn in 2016 that remain vacant, which together make up the bulk of unused space, experts estimate.""How many vacant homes are there now? Each expert gives a very different number, with the most extreme believing the current number of vacant homes are enough for 3 billion people,"" said He Keng, 81, a former deputy head of the statistics bureau.""That estimate might be a bit much, but 1.4 billion people probably can't fill them,"" He said at a forum in the southern Chinese city Dongguan, according to a video released by the official media China News Service.His negative view of the economically significant sector at a public forum stands in sharp contrast to the official narrative that the Chinese economy is ""resilient"". ""All sorts of comments predicting the collapse of China's economy keep surfacing every now and then, but what has collapsed is such rhetoric, not China's economy,"" a spokesperson at the foreign ministry said at a recent news conference.

Atlanta-based UPS said it is modifying driver training for those who are deaf and hard of hearing and would start accepting exemptions to the DOT commercial driver hearing standard for operators of its ubiquitous brown delivery trucks in January 2024. UPS said training is necessary because ""current regulations do not consider best practices for driving larger commercial vehicles that make frequent stops in residential neighborhoods, or other significant factors UPS considers as it works to help keep its drivers and communities safe.""

117,Pennsylvania doubles Amtrak service with $200m infrastructure investment ,2023-09-22 13:06:00-04:00,"Position added successfully to: 
Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro announced an expansion of Amtrak's New York City-Harrisburg-Pittsburgh service on Friday, doubling its frequency from once to twice daily. The expansion is a result of an agreement between the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and  Norfolk Southern  Corporation (NYSE:NSC), and will be facilitated by a $200 million investment from the commonwealth.The agreement aims to enhance passenger rail service in Western Pennsylvania while preserving a critical freight rail corridor. ""This agreement lays the groundwork for expanded passenger rail service in Western Pennsylvania,"" said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. He further emphasized that the agreement would provide key mobility and economic benefits by reducing commute times, connecting hundreds of thousands of residents, and boosting local economies.The commonwealth's investment will be directed towards ""infrastructure and safety improvements"" built and maintained by Norfolk Southern. These include upgraded rail lines, sidings, and necessary communications signals infrastructure. PennDOT has also applied for grant funds through the Federal Railroad Administration to help finance these improvements.Supporters of the agreement believe it aligns with statewide aspirations for expanding passenger rail. Senator Wayne Langerholc, R-Clearfield and chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, praised the announcement, noting that it keeps Pennsylvania on course to achieving more rail service for western Pennsylvanians, a goal he prioritized upon election.In addition to serving more Pennsylvanians with modern, reliable passenger rail, this expansion is expected to connect Pennsylvania communities and stimulate job creation, economic development, and infrastructure investment. The move is seen as a win-win for business and passengers alike.In related developments across the state, the Schuylkill River Passenger Rail Authority in eastern Pennsylvania awaits news from the Federal Railroad Administration regarding a $500,000 grant to plan for a potential route between Philadelphia and Reading.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

118,Arm Holdings' debut on NYSE met with caution by analysts ,2023-09-22 13:14:00-04:00," Arm  Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), the chip-design company, made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) recently, experiencing an initial surge in share price before settling close to its listing price. However, financial analysts from Susquehanna Financial Group, Christopher Rolland and Mehdi Hosseini, have urged investors to exercise caution as they believe the company's stock is currently appropriately valued.On Friday, Arm Holdings' shares fell by 1.7% to $51.32, a significant decrease from their peak of over $60 per share reached shortly after the company's initial public offering (IPO). The IPO was priced at $51 a share.Rolland and Hosseini initiated their coverage of Arm with a neutral rating, setting a share-price target of $48. This target was calculated based on an enterprise value that is 15 times Arm's forecast sales for 2024. Despite the company's role in advancing artificial intelligence (AI), the analysts identified several challenges that might affect its market performance.The primary concern raised by the analysts is the sluggish growth in mobile handsets, currently the largest market for Arm's chip designs. They suggested that these circumstances might necessitate Arm to increase its royalty rates and diversify into new sectors in order to justify its premium valuation.The analysts also pointed out potential risks associated with expanding royalty rates for core customers and margin contraction linked to additional revenue streams. As a result of these factors, Rolland and Hosseini concluded that Arm Holdings should trade at a valuation discount compared to its stock performance over the past decade.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

119,"UAW strikes more GM, Stellantis facilities, cites progress in talks with Ford ",2023-09-21 21:03:00-04:00,") -The United Auto Workers expanded its strikes against Detroit automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), but kept its Ford (NYSE:F) walkout limited to a single plant due to progress made in talks, the union said on Friday. The auto workers' union began strikes at noon EDT (1600 GMT) on Friday against 38 parts distribution centers across the United States at GM and Stellantis, extending its unprecedented, simultaneous strikes that began with one assembly plant each of the Detroit Three. The additional facilities added about 5,600 workers to the 12,700 already on strike.UAW President Shawn Fain said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:META) live event that by targeting distribution centers the strike becomes a nationwide event. He said he expected talks to continue through the weekend.Hours after Fain invited President Joe Biden to visit a picket line, Biden said in a social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he would come to Michigan on Tuesday ""to join the picket line and stand in solidarity with the men and women of UAW."" He added: ""It’s time for a win-win agreement that keeps American auto manufacturing thriving with well-paid UAW jobs."" The president has been vocal in his support for the union's demands for better pay and benefits. Former President Donald Trump, who is seeking a new term, will be in Michigan on Wednesday to address auto workers, his campaign said.Fain said the decision on the expanded strike would impact consumers trying to obtain repair parts. The distribution centers are warehouses that ship parts to dealers and other retailers for use in repairs. ""We will be everywhere from California to Massachusetts, from Oregon to Florida."" At a GM parts distribution center outside Philadelphia, picketing workers said the strike will result in cars sitting longer for repairs but that is the only way to get the higher wages they seek.""If you look at the past few years, car prices went up 30% but our wages went up 6%. We are not the problem,"" said Thomas Morris, 60, who has worked at the center in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, for the past four decades. ""I understand it’s going to cost some pain for people, but we are just looking for fairness.""Fain said they have more work to do at Ford, but ""we do want to recognize that Ford is showing they're serious about reaching a deal."" He added: ""Stellantis and GM in particular are going to need some serious pushing."" He also threatened more action at Stellantis' critical parts plants in his hometown of Kokomo, Indiana. Stellantis has four factories in Kokomo that make engines and transmissions used widely across the automaker's product line. Stellantis has said it wants to be able to consolidate and close some of its parts distribution centers.Fain said Ford had improved its contract offer, including boosting profit sharing and agreeing to let workers strike over plant closures but said the union still has ""serious issues"" with Ford. GM said in a statement that UAW leaders are ""manipulating the bargaining process for their own personal agendas"" and called the strike escalation ""unnecessary."" Stellantis said on Thursday it made a ""very competitive offer"" and said the union's leadership seems ""more concerned about pursuing their own political agendas.""GM, which said it had contingency plans it did not specify to protect its business and customers, said it has made five separate offers to the union.Ford said it is continuing to negotiate, adding that ""we have more work ahead of us before we can reach an agreement."" Nearly 13,000 UAW workers walked out at plants in Missouri, Michigan and Ohio on Sept 15. Those plants produce the Ford Bronco, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet Colorado, alongside other popular models. But Ford and Canadian union Unifor reached a last-minute deal to avoid a walkout on Tuesday. Unifor's Ford leadership unanimously endorsed the tentative agreement late on Friday. Ratification meetings for members were set for Saturday, Unifor said.Wedbush Analyst Daniel Ives said this latest move by the UAW marks a divergence in the talks with the automakers.""The current deal is a torpedo to the business models of the Detroit 3,"" he said. ""To take a deal just to avoid a strike and get it done is great for the next 24 hours but a nightmare for the next 30 years.""Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said Ford's family-controlled structure gives it a different focus than the other two. ""GM and Stellantis are looking at stockholder value and Ford is looking a lot more long-term that they have to make friends with labor."" The standoff is fueling worries about prolonged industrial action that could disrupt production and dent U.S. economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers.The automakers have proposed 20% raises over 4-1/2 years, while the UAW is seeking 40%.The union also wants to eliminate wage gaps separating newer and older employees, as well as workers in certain component operations and those in assembly plants. Fain said on Friday that the union had negotiated the elimination of lower wage tiers in some components facilities at Ford and GM. But Stellantis has not agreed to raise wages at its MOPAR component operations, Fain said.

120,Supermarket franchisee Spinneys Dubai plans IPO in 2024 ,2023-09-24 02:43:00-04:00,") - Spinneys Dubai LLC, the franchisee of the supermarket chain in the United Arab Emirates and Oman, is planning an initial public offering of the business in the second quarter of 2024, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.Albwardy Investment, the franchise's 100% owner, hired Rothschild & Co to advise on the planned IPO, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the plans are not public.It invited banks this week to pitch for roles in the offering, expected to be up to 30% of the company, the sources added.Spinneys, Albwardy and Rothschild did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.The potential IPO of Spinneys Dubai, planned on the Dubai Financial Market, would add to the small but growing regional food retail sector.Americana Restaurants, the Middle East and North Africa franchisee of fast food restaurants KFC and Pizza Hut, as well as a seller of frozen foods, debuted in a dual listing in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh in December.Lulu Group, a hypermarket and mall operator, expects its IPO in the first half of 2024, its chairman said earlier this month, adding that it hired Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co to advise it, confirming an October 2022 Reuters report.IPO activity in the Gulf is expected to pick up after the pace slowed from an exceptional 2022, when Saudi Arabia and the UAE led new listings, raising nearly $22 billion - more than half the total for the wider Europe, Middle East and Africa region, Dealogic data shows.Middle Eastern companies still raised $5.3 billion in the first half of this year through 23 market debuts.Spinneys Dubai operates more than 65 stores across the UAE, its website says. In addition, it operates at least seven stores in Oman, Albwardy's website says.Albwardy, which says it has annual turnover above $1 billion, also owns the franchise rights to upmarket British supermarket chain Waitrose.Founded in the mid-1970s, it has a hospitality portfolio that includes several Four Seasons hotels and food distribution investments that include Nestle UAE.Other sectors in Albwardy's portfolio are industrial and engineering, commercial and insurance, agribusiness and properties.

121,US Supreme Court extends pause on order curbing Biden social media contacts ,2023-09-22 12:28:00-04:00,") - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Friday extended a temporary block on an order restricting the ability of President Joe Biden's administration to encourage social media companies to remove content it deemed misinformation about COVID-19 and other matters of public concern.The decision to keep the matter on hold until Wednesday gives the court more time to consider the administration's request to block an injunction issued by a lower court that had concluded that federal officials likely had violated the free speech protections of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment by coercing social media platforms into censoring certain posts.Alito's order pauses the dispute until Sept. 27 at 11:59 p.m. EDT. He had previously halted the lower court's rulingthrough Sept. 22. Alito is the justice designated by the court to act on certain matters arising from a group of states that include Louisiana, where the lawsuit was first filed.The Republican attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana and a group of social media users sued federal officials, accusing them of unlawfully helping suppress conservative-leaning constitutionally protected speech on major social medial platforms.Those platforms included Meta's Facebook (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube and X, formerly called Twitter. Many of the posts expressed opinions that federal officials said constituted misinformation about the pandemic.The Biden administration argued that officials did nothing illegal and had sought to mitigate the hazards of online misinformation by alerting social media companies to content that violated their own policies.Louisiana-based U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty in July concluded that government officials had coercively pressured the companies to suppress posts by users that expressed views that were against COVID-19 vaccines, pandemic-related lockdowns intended as public health measures or that questioned the results of the 2020 election in which Biden, a Democrat, defeated Donald Trump, a Republican.The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated much of an injunction that Doughty issued restricting the administration's social media communications, with the exception of a provision concerning coercion, which they narrowed.The narrowed injunction applied to the White House, the surgeon general, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FBI, saying they could not ""coerce or significantly encourage"" the companies to remove content.The administration told the Supreme Court that the remaining injunction still went too far and would interfere with how the White House, FBI and health officials address matters of public concern and security.

122,"Factbox-US government shutdown: What closes, what stays open? ",2023-09-21 10:23:00-04:00,") -U.S. government services would be disrupted and hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed without pay if Congress fails to provide funding for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Workers deemed ""essential"" would remain on the job, but without pay.Many government agencies have not updated shutdown plans they have prepared in the past. Here is a guide to what would stay open and what would shut down:MILITARYThe 2 million U.S. military personnel would remain at their posts, but roughly half of the Pentagon's 800,000 civilian employees would be furloughed.Contracts awarded before the shutdown would continue, and the Pentagon could place new orders for supplies or services needed to protect national security. Other new contracts, including renewals or extensions, would not be awarded. Payments to defense contractors such as Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and RTX, formerly known as Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), could be delayed.The Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration would continue maintaining nuclear weapons.LAW ENFORCEMENTAccording to the Justice Department's 2021 contingency plan, agents at the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other federal law enforcement agencies would remain on the job, and prison staffers would continue to work.Criminal prosecutions, including the two federal cases against former President Donald Trump, would continue. Most civil litigation would be postponed.Aid to local police departments and other grants could be delayed.Border Patrol and immigration enforcement agents would continue to work, as would customs officers, according to the Department of Homeland Security's 2022 plan. The Secret Service and the Coast Guard would also continue operations.Most of the Federal Trade Commission's consumer-protection workers would be furloughed, as would half of its antitrust employees.FEDERAL COURTSFederal courts have enough money to stay open until at least Oct. 13. Activities might be scaled back after that point. The Supreme Court would stay open as well.TRANSPORTATIONAirport security screeners and air-traffic control workers would be required to work, according to recent contingency plans, though absenteeism could be a problem. Some airports had to suspend operations during a shutdown in 2019 when traffic controllers called in sick.Training for new air traffic controllers would stop, which Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has warned could worsen a shortage of qualified workers.Some major infrastructure projects could face delays as environmental reviews and permitting would be disrupted, according to the White House.FOREIGN AFFAIRSU.S. embassies and consulates would remain open under the State Department's 2022 shutdown plan. Passport and visa processing would continue as long as there were sufficient fees to cover operations. Nonessential official travel, speeches and other events would be curtailed.Some foreign aid programs could run out of money as well.NATIONAL PARKS AND NATURAL RESOURCESIt's not clear how national parks, national monuments and other sites would be affected. Many remained open during a 2018-2019 shutdown, through restrooms and information desks were closed and waste disposal was halted. They were closed during a 2013 shutdown.Wildfire fighting efforts would continue, according to the Agriculture Department's 2020 contingency plan, though timber sales on national forest lands would be curtailed and fewer recreation permits would be issued.SCIENCEScientific research would be disrupted as agencies like the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) would furlough most of their workers, according to recent contingency plans.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) would continue to support the International Space Station and track satellites, but 17,000 of its 18,300 employees would be furloughed.Weather forecasts and fisheries regulation would continue, as would patent and trademark reviews. Tests of new drugs and medical devices would continue.HEALTHThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would continue to monitor disease outbreaks, though other public health activities could suffer as more than half of the agency's workers would be furloughed.The National Institutes of Health would furlough most of its staff and delay new clinical trials for medical treatments.Healthcare services for veterans and Native Americans would continue.Most inspections of hazardous waste sites and drinking water and chemical facilities would stop.Food-safety inspections by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could be delayed.FINANCIAL REGULATIONThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would furlough roughly 90% of its 4,600 employees and suspend most activities, leaving only a skeleton staff to respond to emergencies.Likewise, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) would furlough almost all of its employees and cease oversight, enforcement and regulation, according to its 2021 plan.The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would continue as normal, as they are funded by industry fees rather than congressional appropriations.ECONOMIC DATAImportant economic data reports from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics would be suspended, including the monthly unemployment report, due out on Oct. 6, and price reports due the following week. Reports from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Census Bureau could be suspended as well, including retail sales and housing starts.SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE AND OTHER BENEFITSThe Social Security Administration would continue to issue retirement and disability benefits, and payments would continue under the Medicare and Medicaid health programs.Military veterans' benefits would also continue, according to a 2021 contingency plan.Food assistance administered through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could be affected, as grocery stores would not be able to renew their licenses.TAX COLLECTIONThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would operate as normal, and all 83,000 employees would continue to be paid because the agency's funding would not expire.DISASTER RESPONSEThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would risk running out of funds for disaster relief and long-term recovery projects.EDUCATIONPell Grants and student loans would continue to be paid, but could be disrupted as most Education Department employees would be furloughed, according to the agency's 2021 plan.A protracted shutdown could ""severely curtail"" aid to schools, universities and other educational institutions, the department says. It also could delay funds that are due to be awarded later in the year.CHILD CAREAccording to the White House, 10,000 children from low-income families would lose access to the Head Start preschool program.SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORTThe Small Business Administration would not be able to issue any new loans, though loans for businesses hurt by natural disasters would continue.LABORWorkplace safety inspections would be limited and investigations into unfair pay practices would be suspended, according to the White House.The ability of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to mediate labor disputes would be curtailed because almost all of its 1,200 employees would be furloughed, according to a 2022 plan.WHITE HOUSEIn the 2018-2019 shutdown, the White House furloughed 1,100 of 1,800 staff in the Executive Office of the President. Some offices, such as the National Security Council, continued at full strength, while others like the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) were scaled back sharply.White House furloughs could make it harder to comply with the impeachment investigation of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, by Republicans in the House of Representatives.MAIL DELIVERYThe U.S. Postal Service (USPS) would be unaffected as it does not depend on Congress for funding.

Asian stock markets are preparing for a cautious commencement to the week today, as investors evaluate the potential impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy stance. Japanese futures remained steady on Sunday, while Australian futures and Hong Kong stock contracts experienced slight declines. In contrast, an index of U.S.-listed Chinese companies saw an increase, following the announcement that Washington and Beijing are setting up working groups to discuss economic and financial matters.In early Monday trading in Asia, S&P 500 futures rose by 0.2%, recovering from Friday's equivalent fall that marked its poorest week since March. Nasdaq 100 futures also increased by 0.2%, buoyed by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).'s latest product sales which contributed to the stability of the underlying index on Friday.The upcoming week will see U.S. Treasuries once again under scrutiny due to scheduled public appearances by Federal Reserve officials. Investors are also awaiting key U.S. inflation data and assessing the potential implications of a possible U.S. government shutdown.According to market analyst Fawad Razaqzada from City Index and Forex.com, traders remain wary about inflation and policy direction in light of the recent oil surge and the Fed's hint that interest rates will not decrease in the near future.Two Federal Reserve officials suggested last week that at least one more rate hike could be forthcoming, with borrowing costs potentially needing to stay high for a longer period for inflation to return to its 2% target. Boston Fed President Susan Collins did not rule out further tightening, while Governor Michelle Bowman suggested that more than one increase might be necessary, reinforcing her status as one of the Federal Open Market Committee's most hawkish members.San Francisco Fed Bank President Mary Daly stated last week that it is premature to claim victory over inflation, reaffirming the central bank's continued commitment to manage price pressures as smoothly as possible.Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)'s rate strategists predict that the yield on 10-year Treasuries could reach 4.75% before softer risk sentiment and tighter financial conditions drive it down by year-end.In other market news, oil prices are approaching their annual high, while Bitcoin remained steady around $26,500.The week ahead is packed with key events including speeches by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and ECB's Francois Villeroy de Galhau on Monday. This will be followed by the release of U.S. new home sales data and Conference Board consumer confidence on Tuesday, with ECB's Philip Lane also scheduled to speak. Other highlights include China's industrial profits data and U.S. durable goods data on Wednesday, Eurozone economic and consumer confidence data on Thursday, and U.S. initial jobless claims and GDP data.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

124,"'Power, influence, notoriety': The Gen-Z hackers who struck MGM, Caesars ",2023-09-22 02:09:00-04:00,") - About a year ago, the U.S. security firm Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) began to hear from a flurry of companies that had been hacked in ways that weren't the norm for cybercriminals. Native English-speaking hackers would call up a target company’s information technology helpdesk posing as an employee, and seek login details by pretending to have lost theirs. They had all the employee information needed to sound convincing. And once they got access, they’d quickly find their way into the company's most sensitive repositories to steal that data for extortion.Ransomware attacks are not new, but this group was extraordinarily skilled at social engineering and bypassing multi-factor authentication, said Wendi Whitmore, senior vice president for the security firm Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team, which has responded to several intrusions tied to the group.""They are much more sophisticated than many cybercriminal actors. They appear to be disciplined and organized in their attacks,"" she said. ""And that's something we typically see more frequently with nation-state actors, versus cyber criminals.""Known in the security industry variously as Scattered Spider, Muddled Libra, and UNC3944, these hackers were thrust into the limelight earlier this month for breaching the systems of two of the world's largest gambling companies - MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) and Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) Entertainment Ltd.Behind the scenes, it has hit many more companies, according to analysts tracking the intrusions - and cybersecurity specialists expect the attacks to continue. The FBI is investigating the MGM and Caesars breaches, and the companies did not comment on who may be behind them.From Canada to Japan, the security firm CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has tracked 52 attacks globally by the group since March 2022, most of them in the United States, said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of threat intelligence at the company. Google-owned intelligence firm Mandiant, has logged more than 100 intrusions by it in the last two years. Nearly every industry, from telecommunications to finance, hospitality, and media, has been hit. Reuters was not able to determine how much money the hackers may have extorted.But it's not just the scale or the breadth of attacks that make this group stand out. They're extremely good at what they do and ""ruthless"" in their interactions with victims, said Kevin Mandia, Mandiant's founder.The speed at which they breach and exfiltrate data from company systems can overwhelm security response teams, and they have left threatening notes for staff of victim organizations on their systems, and contacted them by text and email in the past, Mandiant found.In some cases - Mandia did not say which ones - hackers tied to Scattered Spider placed bogus emergency calls to summon heavily armed police units to the homes of executives of targeted companies. The technique, called SWATing, ""is something that’s utterly dreadful to live through as a victim,"" he said. ""I don’t even think these intrusions are about money. I think they’re about power, influence and notoriety. That makes it harder to respond to.""Reuters couldn't immediately reach the hacking group for comment. 17-22 YEAR OLDS There's little detail on Scattered Spider's location or identity. Based on the criminals’ chats with victims and clues gleaned from breach investigations, CrowdStrike's Meyers said they are largely 17-22 years-olds. Mandiant estimates they’re mainly from Western countries, but it's unclear how many people are involved. Before calling helpdesks, the hackers acquire employee information including passwords by social engineering, especially 'SIM swapping' - a technique where they trick a telecom company's customer service representative to reassign a specific phone number from one device to another, analysts say.They also appear to make the effort to study how large organizations work, including their vendors and contractors, to find individuals with privileged access they can target, according to analysts. That’s something David Bradbury, chief security officer of the identity management firm Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), saw first-hand last month, when he discovered multiple Okta customers – including MGM – breached by Scattered Spider. Okta provides identity services such as multi-factor authentication used to help users securely access online applications and websites.""The threat actors have clearly taken our courses that we provide online, they've clearly studied our product and how it works,"" Bradbury said. ""This is stuff we haven't seen before."" A larger group named ALPHV said last week it was behind the MGM hack, and analysts believe it provided the software and attack tools for the operation to be carried out by Scattered Spider. Such collaborations are typical for cybercriminals, said Okta's Bradbury. ALPHV, which according to Mandiant is a ""ransomware-as-a-service"", would provide services such as a helpdesk, webpage and branding, and in turn get a cut of whatever Scattered Spider would make from the hack. While many ransomware attacks go unpublicised, the MGM hack was a vivid example of the real-world impact of such incidents. It caused chaos in Las Vegas, as gaming machines stalled and hotel systems were disrupted. Ransomware gangs often function like large organizations, and continue to evolve their methods to adapt to the latest security measures organizations use. ""In some ways this is just like the age-old game of cat and mouse,"" said Whitmore, who compared Scattered Spider to Lapsus$, another group behind previous hacks into Okta and the technology giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The British police last year arrested seven people between the ages of 16 and 21 following those hacks.

126,"X social media's India, South Asia policy head Gupta resigns-sources ",2023-09-22 21:16:00-04:00,") - Social media platform X's head of policy for India and South Asia, Samiran Gupta, has resigned, two sources said, a top departure that comes ahead of India elections and as the company fights a court battle with New Delhi over content removal.Gupta was the most senior India employee for X, formerly known as Twitter, and responsible for ""key content-related policy issues"" and ""defending Twitter's position with new policy developments and support in-country sales organization,"" according to his LinkedIn profile.Gupta, who was designated as X's Head of Global Government Affairs for India and South Asia, declined to comment to Reuters. X did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Gupta's tenure at X ended in September, according to Gupta's LinkedIn profile, which said he ""enabled transition leadership for Twitter post acquisition by Elon Musk led X-Corp."" He had joined the company in February, 2022, eight months before Musk completed his $44 billion acquisition of  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). X counts India as a key market, with around 27 million users. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other government officials are regular users of the platform.There are roughly 15 X employees in functions like compliance and engineering in India, said one of the sources, but Gupta was the only executive engaging with the government and political parties.Interaction between X and government and party officials would intensify typically during the run up to polls, and a national election is due to take place in India next year.X is appealing against an Indian court ruling that it had failed to comply with government orders to remove certain content, arguing it could embolden New Delhi to block more content and broaden the scope for censorship.India in September told a court X is a ""habitual non-compliant platform"" and for years has not followed many orders to remove content, undermining the government's role.

127,Explainer-What you need to know about RSV and the new vaccines ,2023-09-22 10:18:00-04:00,") -The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday recommended  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for women in the middle of the third trimester of pregnancy to protect their babies from severe illness.That Pfizer shot and one developed by GSK in May became the first two RSV vaccines to win U.S. approval, for use in people aged 60 and over to prevent severe illness. In August, Pfizer's vaccine also won approval for the maternal use. Here's what you need to know. What is RSV? RSV is a usually seasonal respiratory virus that generally causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Still, infants and older adults have a higher risk of developing severe RSV.RSV leads to 58,000 to 80,000 hospitalizations among children under age 5, and 60,000 to 160,000 hospitalizations among adults age 65 and older each year, according to the CDC. It causes around 14,000 deaths in adults aged 65 and older in the U.S. annually, according to government estimates. Who should get the vaccines?The U.S. CDC has recommended that adults aged 60 or older may get the shot after discussions with a healthcare provider about whether RSV vaccination is right for them. The agency stopped short of saying all adults over the age of 60 should receive it this year.Outside advisers to the CDC suggested the narrower recommendation in June after expressing concern that there was not sufficient data on how effective the vaccines are in people over age 75 and in other high-risk groups.CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen formally recommended use of the vaccine in expecting mothers to protect infants up to age 6 months after the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted 11-1 in its favor. The panel recommended use of the shot in women 32 weeks to 36 weeks into their pregnancy from September to January, in order to protect babies born in peak RSV season.How often do I need to get the vaccine to stay protected?Early data suggests that the RSV shots are protective for at least two years, but it is not yet clear how often older adults will need to be revaccinated. CDC advisers will consider the frequency of revaccination when more data becomes available.What else is available to protect infants from RSV?In July, the FDA also approved Beyfortus, a long-acting antibody therapy from  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) and partner AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), to prevent RSV in children up to 24 months of age.Previously, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum's Synagis was the only approved preventive therapy in the U.S. for high-risk infants. Synagis is given as monthly injections, while Beyfortus can be given annually.Are RSV cases on the rise?Yes, although not alarmingly so. Detection of the virus in testing has increased significantly over the last month to around the same levels as this spring, according to CDC data. Still, that is a fraction of the positive tests recorded at the same time a year ago, when RSV cases were surging around the country and hospitals were running out of pediatric beds.Can I get the RSV shot alongside my COVID and flu shots?Yes, current CDC guidelines allow for all three vaccines to be administered simultaneously, even though they have not been tested together.""If it's now or never again, it's best to get all the vaccines you're eligible for to get the protection against as many diseases as possible,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, a member of the board of directors for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. ""If you've got the luxury of returning for more than one visit, you can choose to space them out."" Will my insurance cover it?Adults who are insured under the U.S. Medicare program for people aged 65 and older or disabled are covered for the vaccine. Many private insurance plans, including large insurers like CVS Health (NYSE:CVS)'s Aetna, Humana (NYSE:HUM) and Elevance, which owns Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers including Anthem, also say they are covering the shot for adults 60 and older who are not yet eligible for Medicare.

128,Oracle spends more than $100 million on Ampere chips ,2023-09-22 13:33:00-04:00,") -Oracle Corp agreed to prepay $104.1 million for processor chips made by startup Ampere Computing, according to Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)'s proxy statement filed on Friday.Oracle also invested $400 million in Ampere through a convertible note in its fiscal 2023, the proxy said.Ampere builds custom server chips based on Arm technology that compete with designs produced by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which use X86. Oracle has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Ampere since it was founded, according to filings.The idea behind the investment in Ampere – and its chip purchases - is to give Oracle's cloud an advantage over rivals. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) makes its own server chips that compete with Ampere, and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) makes its own artificial intelligence processors.Ampere declined to comment. Oracle did not return a request for comment.

129,Exclusive-Germany scraps plans for more stringent building standards to prop up industry ,2023-09-24 14:04:00-04:00,") - The German government will put on indefinite hold plans to require more stringent building insulation standards, environment minister Robert Habeck told Reuters, an effort to help prop up the ailing building industry.The about-face from the German government comes ahead of a closely watched meeting between the building industry and government leaders with Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday to address a major slump in the sector.Abolition of the insulation standards has been a top demand of industry, which says the measures are too expensive and put a further damper on the depressed construction industry.""High interest rates and inflation are a heavy burden for the construction industry,"" Habeck told Reuters, noting that the insulation measures now ""can wait"".""I don't see this new standard being introduced in this legislative period,"" he said. The period runs until late 2025.For years, low interest rates fuelled a global boom, igniting interest in German property, seen as safe and stable as the country. A sharp rise in rates put an end to the run, tipping a string of developers into insolvency as deals froze and prices fell.German housing prices fell by the most since records began in the second quarter, the latest grim sign for the property market in Europe's largest economy, government data showed on Friday.Also last week, data showed that building permits for apartments in Germany fell 31.5% in July from a year earlier, highlighting a slump in demand plaguing the construction and real estate industry.Germany, whose population has recently grown as millions flock to the country, aims to build 400,000 apartments a year, but has struggled.Weakness in commercial real estate in the United States as offices remain empty after the pandemic and the unravelling in Sweden of one of the country's biggest landlords have globally called attention to distress in the sector. China has also seen major property builders struggle.In the weeks ahead of Monday's summit, the industry has been calling on the government for an aid package.

130,Workers with Canadian union Unifor vote in favor of Ford contract ,2023-09-24 07:50:00-04:00,") -Canadian labor union Unifor said on Sunday its members had voted to ratify a new contract with Ford Motor (NYSE:F), a relief for the Detroit automaker locked in a separate tussle with its U.S. union over demands for better pay and benefits in the country.Unifor, which represents about 5,600 Canadian auto workers, said its members at Ford ratified a new three-year collective agreement.Ford has offered the union members wage increases of up to 25% in its new contract. The agreement provides a 10% wage increase for the first year followed by increases of 2% and 3% through the second and third years and a $10,000 productivity and quality bonus to all employees on the active roll of the company. The Detroit automaker reached a last-minute deal earlier this week, preventing walkouts at its Canadian operations. On Friday, the United Auto Workers (UAW) union announced an expansion of its U.S. strikes against General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA). The UAW said it had made real progress in talks with Ford, but that its workers would remain on strike at the automaker's Wayne, Michigan, assembly plant.Unifor had sought improved wages and pensions, support in the transition to electric vehicles and additional investment commitments from Ford. The union has yet to reach a deal with Stellantis and GM to avoid walkouts at their Canadian facilities.Ford's new deal covers Unifor members at the company's plants in Ontario, as well as its parts distribution centers in Bramalea and Paris, Ontario, and in Alberta.Unlike the UAW, Unifor chose one of the Detroit Three as a ""target"" to negotiate with first - in this case, Ford - in a pattern bargaining tactic used to set the tone for subsequent deals with other companies.

131,UAW union files labor complaint against US Senator Tim Scott ,2023-09-22 16:02:00-04:00,") - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union has filed a labor complaint against Republican presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Tim Scott after his suggestion that auto workers on strike should be terminated.THE TAKEShawn Fain, the president of UAW, filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, claiming Scott's remarks earlier this week violated federal labor law and in making those remarks he was in violation of the right to strike.KEY QUOTESAt a campaign event on Monday, Scott said: ""I think (former U.S. President) Ronald Reagan gave us a great example when federal employees decided they were going to strike. He said, you strike, you're fired. Simple concept to me. ... To the extent that we can use that once again, absolutely.""Scott doubled down on Friday after the complaint against him and said UAW ""is one of the most corrupt and scandal-plagued unions"" in the United States. ""They want to threaten me & shut me up. They don't scare me,"" he said on messaging platform X.CONTEXT* The United Auto Workers expanded its strikes against Detroit automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler parent Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), but kept its Ford (NYSE:F) walkout limited to a single plant due to progress made in talks, the union said on Friday.* The auto workers' union began strikes at noon ET (1600 GMT) on Friday against 38 parts distribution centers across the United States at GM and Stellantis, extending its unprecedented, simultaneous strikes that began with one assembly plant at each of the Detroit Three. The additional facilities added about 5,600 workers to the 12,700 already on strike.* The automakers have proposed 20% raises over 4-1/2 years, while the UAW is seeking 40%.

132,Charter Communications sees stock upgrade and price target rise amid growth prospects ,2023-09-22 12:47:00-04:00,"Position added successfully to: 
Wells Fargo, a leading banking institution, upgraded  Charter Communications ' (NASDAQ:CHTR) shares to overweight from equal weight on Friday. The bank also increased the price target for Charter's stock to $550 from $450, suggesting a potential 23% gain. Despite facing challenges in the cable industry due to increasing prices and the growing popularity of streaming services, Charter's stock has rallied by 31.8% this year.Analyst Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo attributed this positive outlook for Charter to its advantageous debt structure and expanding sports content. He highlighted that these factors would bolster Charter's market share in the streaming industry over the long term. Cahall stated, ""The worst of Cable is behind it, and CHTR is the clearest expression of the new normal. It has a strong converged bundle with Spectrum One, stable net adds due to its expansion in rural and a more aggressive video posture with programmers.""Charter's growth prospects, particularly in rural areas, also played a significant role in the rating uplift. The company's CEO Christopher Winfrey declared during a second-quarter earnings call in late July that Charter is currently the largest and fastest-growing rural provider in the nation.Furthermore, CFO Jessica Fischer emphasized that their rural construction initiative is disbursing at a steadier pace than in past years. This consistent spending strategy comes as the company reported an improvement in customer losses in its second quarter compared to the previous year.Charter's Spectrum One bundle offering, introduced in October 2022, is another factor contributing to its positive outlook. Cahall believes that if Charter can achieve strong conversion rates with Spectrum One, it could generate high-margin revenue that enhances EBITDA.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Goodyear would also exit nine warehouse locations, a regulatory filing showed. It follows the company's similar decision announced earlier in the month for Europe, the Middle East and Africa that would lead to 1,200 job cuts. The Ohio-based company said the approved plan that is part of its broader restructuring effort would be completed by the end of 2024. The pre-tax charges are estimated between $55 million and $65 million. Goodyear, in August, swung to a loss of 73 cents per share for the second quarter, from a profit of 58 cents per share a year earlier.

138,"McDonald's to raise royalty fees for new franchise restaurants in US, Canada ",2023-09-22 03:08:00-04:00,") -McDonald's is raising royalty fees for new franchise restaurants in the U.S. and Canada for the first time in nearly three decades, according to a letter viewed by Reuters on Friday, bringing them on par with what it charges in other markets.The fees are being hiked to 5% from 4%, starting Jan. 1, and will not affect franchises that are looking to rebuild or renovate existing locations or transfer an outlet to another party, the letter showed.The move comes as the restaurant chain sees slowing revenue growth for the rest of the year as signs of easing inflation prompt it to lower menu prices. Northcoast Research analyst Jim Sanderson, however, said the impact of the rate increase on McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) revenue would be ""very limited"", since there are very few new stores opening in the United States.The fast-food giant operates around 13,400 stores across the United States. Around 95% of these were operated by franchisees as of Dec. 31, making up nearly 30% of the company's total revenue in 2022.Average cash flows for these U.S. franchisees have grown more than 35% over the past five years, the letter showed.The company will also change the term for payments from ""service fees"" to ""royalty fees"", used by all other McDonald's markets around the world.Royalty is a fee paid by restaurant operators to the owner and the rate is set based on the revenue generated by the licensed property.

139,India's aviation authorities say they can't interfere in Akasa dispute ,2023-09-23 07:35:00-04:00,") - India's aviation authorities have ruled out intervening in a dispute between Akasa Air and its pilots after the budget carrier accused the regulator of inaction, a legal filing shows.Over 40 of Akasa's 450 pilots quit without serving their notice in recent weeks, and the airline has sued some of them and challenged Indian authorities in court for not acting on its requests to deal with alleged pilot ""misconduct"". The airline has also warned of a shut down due to the crisis.India mandates a notice period of 6-12 months for pilots which some pilot organisations are challenging in court. Akasa argues its contractual obligations with pilots remain in force, and is suing the regulator for not intervening in the public interest.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the aviation ministry in a Sept. 22 filing at the Delhi High Court said Akasa's plea should be thrown out as the regulator is unable to interfere in the matter.The DGCA ""does not have any power or delegated authority to interfere in any employment contract,"" it said.Akasa, which has previously said it was in discussion with the DGCA, did not respond to a request for comment on the new filing, which has been seen by Reuters. A DGCA official declined to comment.Akasa has accused the DGCA of being ""unwilling to take any action"" which resulted in ""significant financial and operational hardship"" to the airlineThe pilot resignations caused 632 flight cancellations in August, according to Akasa, an estimated 18% of the roughly 3,500 flights the airline usually operates in a month.The DGCA contested that position in its court filing, saying it ""categorically denies"" that Akasa ""provided any documents or reasons"" in respect of cancellation as a result of pilot exits.Sharing data, it said only 1.17% of Akasa's flights were cancelled in August.The 6,000 member Federation of Indian Pilots have also responded to Akasa's plea, saying flight cancellation numbers were ""unsubstantiated"" and that the DGCA can not interfere in the dispute.""Alleged mass resignation of pilots ... also serves as an indication of employee discontent,"" the federation said.

140,Apple: A potential Autumn windfall ,2023-09-24 16:46:00-04:00," - The stock market's September turbulence appears to be unfolding as expected. Historical patterns, including election year cycles and ten-year cycles, suggest that the final quarter of the year could see a robust performance.Notably, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has demonstrated a highly seasonal pattern during the fall season. A monthly expected return histogram reveals that September tends to be the weakest month for Apple's stock, typically followed by a strong performance in October. Historical data shows that Apple's stock price ended September lower 67% of the time. However, the stock experienced a rise of over 70% of the time in October. If the stock price has dipped in September, the odds of a robust October performance increase to 75%.A more detailed analysis reveals that from October 3rd through December 7th, Apple's share price has seen an increase nearly 70% of the time, with an average gain exceeding 13%.The monthly dynamic cycle for Apple's shares tends to bottom out in October. In the past year, two buy signals have been generated, both of which have resulted in successful investments.However, it's worth noting that the current market turbulence may not have fully played out. Therefore, it might be prudent to postpone any potential investments until the first week of October.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-a-potential-autumn-windfall-3181277#comments,investing.com,2023-09-22,"['apple', 'a', 'potential', 'autumn', 'windfall', 'the', 'stock', 'market', 'september', 'turbulence', 'appear', 'unfold', 'expect', 'historical', 'pattern', 'include', 'election', 'year', 'cycle', 'cycle', 'suggest', 'final', 'quarter', 'year', 'could', 'see', 'robust', 'apple', 'inc', 'nasdaq', 'aapl', 'demonstrate', 'highly', 'seasonal', 'pattern', 'fall', 'season', 'a', 'monthly', 'expect', 'return', 'histogram', 'reveals', 'september', 'tend', 'weak', 'month', 'apple', 'stock', 'typically', 'follow', 'strong', 'performance', 'october', 'historical', 'data', 'show', 'apple', 'stock', 'price', 'end', 'september', 'low', 'time', 'however', 'stock', 'experience', 'rise', 'time', 'october', 'if', 'stock', 'price', 'dip', 'september', 'odds', 'robust', 'october', 'performance', 'increase', 'detail', 'analysis', 'reveals', 'october', 'december', 'apple', 'share', 'price', 'see', 'increase', 'nearly', 'time', 'average', 'gain', 'exceed', 'monthly', 'dynamic', 'cycle', 'apple', 'share', 'tend', 'bottom', 'october', 'in', 'past', 'year', 'two', 'buy', 'signal', 'generate', 'resulted', 'successful', 'worth', 'note', 'current', 'market', 'turbulence', 'may', 'fully', 'play', 'therefore', 'might', 'prudent', 'postpone', 'potential', 'investment', 'first', 'week', 'october']"

142,Qantas warns rising fuel costs may hit fares ,2023-09-24 15:55:00-04:00,") -Australia's biggest airline Qantas Airways said on Monday it will spend more than previously planned to improve ""customer pain points"" but warned spiralling fuel costs may force it to raise fares from already-elevated levels.The update sent its shares down as much as 2.5% to a one-year low as investors questioned the airline's ability to grow profit given persistently high costs.The company, under a new CEO, is trying to navigate a path between reassuring customers it is taking seriously complaints of widespread service problems while telling investors it can contain a surge in costs linked to tight oil supply.The airline that sells three in five Australian domestic fares has seen its reputation tumble in its home market as its handling of the post-COVID travel revival brought a wave of flight cancellations and reports of lost luggage. Adding to its woes, last month the antitrust regulator sued Qantas accusing it of selling fares on thousands of already-cancelled flights in 2022. Qantas also lost a union lawsuit when the High Court found its 2020 sacking of thousands of groundstaff was illegal.The so-called ""flying kangaroo"" said it would now spend A$80 million ($52 million) on ""customer improvements"" on top of the A$150 million previously flagged.""This additional investment is aimed at addressing a number of customer 'pain points' through improvements such as better contact centre resourcing and training ... more generous recovery support when operational issues arise, a review of longstanding policies for fairness and improvements to the quality of inflight catering,"" it said in the trading update.At the same time, it said its forecast half-year fuel bill would jump by A$200 million ($129 million) to A$2.8 billion if the 30% jump in fuel prices it had faced since May persisted.""The group will continue to absorb these higher costs, but will monitor fuel prices in the weeks ahead and, if current levels are sustained, will look to adjust its settings,"" Qantas said.""Any changes would look to balance the recovery of higher costs with the importance of affordable travel in an environment where fares are already elevated.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Owen Birrell said the company would likely absorb the higher fuel costs ""until its target margins come under pressure and then would seek to claw back those costs through capacity cuts and higher fares.""We don't believe a material earnings shift is feasible from here given rising competition, growing consumer/business cost pressures and incoming re-investment in the product/platform,"" he said in a client note.($1 = 1.5559 Australian dollars)

143,Trump lawyer says NY attorney general has no fraud case ,2023-09-22 02:17:00-04:00,") -A lawyer for Donald Trump on Friday accused New York Attorney General Letitia James of ignoring ""everything"" as she pursues a civil lawsuit alleging that the former president ran a systematic fraud at his family business.Christopher Kise, Trump's lawyer, made the accusation at a hearing in a New York state court, just 10 days before the scheduled Oct. 2 trial.Justice Arthur Engoron is considering arguments by Trump, his sons Donald Jr. and Eric, and the Trump Organization that the case should be thrown out because there was no fraud, no one was harmed, and the claims are too old.James, in contrast, wants a ruling even before the trial starts that the defendants are liable for fraud.Engoron plans to rule on Sept. 26 on both sides' motions, and suggested that bigger principles are at stake.""We're talking about fairness and honesty in the marketplace,"" he said at the hearing, which lasted nearly five hours. ""The fact that nobody was hurt doesn't mean the case gets dismissed.""James wants at least $250 million in penalties, and to bar Trump and his adult sons from running businesses in New York.Trump holds a big lead in the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, despite also facing four criminal indictments where he has pleaded not guilty.He has denied all wrongdoing, and branded the cases a Democrat ""witch hunt"" against him.THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASSJames accused Trump of lying in financial statements between 2011 and 2021 to obtain better terms on loans and insurance, defrauding banks and insurers.She said the lies included overvaluing properties including his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and Trump Tower penthouse in Manhattan, and inflating his fortune by as much as $3.6 billion.Kise said the evidence was not there, that James' contrary statements did not make it so, and that valuation disputes were immaterial.""The foundation of the case is to ignore everything,"" Kise said. ""The case comes down to prosecuting the defendants for engaging in successful business transactions.""James maintains that Trump knew his valuations were false.This allegedly included valuing Mar-a-Lago at $739 million by pretending it was unrestricted property though Trump had given up rights to develop it other than as a club, and reporting that the penthouse was nearly triple its actual size.""In (the) defendants' world, there's no objective truth,"" said Andrew Amer, a lawyer from James' office. ""Defendants have clearly stepped through the looking glass.""LAWSUIT AGAINST JUDGEIn June, a state appeals court in Manhattan dismissed claims against Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and various other claims predating July 2014 or February 2016 because of statutes of limitations.The court left it to Engoron to determine which parts of the case could proceed. Engoron will also rule on James' request to sanction the defendants for repeatedly raising ""frivolous"" arguments he had already rejected.At Friday's hearing, the judge appeared dissatisfied when Kise suggested that banks might not have relied on Trump's valuations when making loans.""You cannot make false statements and use them in business,"" Engoron said, banging his fist.Last week, Trump sued Engoron, accusing him of taking too long to narrow the case.The lawsuit sought to delay the trial, to allow the defendants to prepare properly after Engoron decides which claims the attorney general can pursue.Defense lawyers have also accused James of ignoring the June appeals court decision.The appeals court is expected to decide next week whether the trial should proceed as scheduled.

146,Inside Vietnam's plans to dent China's rare earths dominance ,2023-09-24 17:05:00-04:00,") - Vietnam plans to restart its biggest rare-earths mine next year with a Western-backed project that could rival the world's largest, according to two companies involved, as part of a broader push to dent China's dominance in a sector that helps power advanced technologies.The move would be a step toward the Southeast Asian country's aim of building up a rare-earths supply chain, including developing its capacity to refine ores into metals used in magnets for electric vehicles, smartphones and wind turbines.As an initial step, Vietnam's government intends to launch tenders for multiple blocks of its Dong Pao mine before the year's end, said Tessa Kutscher, an executive at Australia's Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Minerals Ltd, which plans to bid for at least one concession. She cited unpublished information from Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, which did not respond to requests for comment.The auction's timing could change but the government plans to restart the mine next year, said Luu Anh Tuan, chairman of Vietnam Rare Earth JSC (VTRE), the country's main refiner and Blackstone's partner in the project.The proposed restart of Dong Pao - whose timeline, scale and degree of foreign financial support have not been reported previously - comes as many nations fret about their vulnerability to supply disruptions due to China's stranglehold on strategic minerals and its disputes with the U.S. and its allies. Beijing this year imposed export curbs on minor metals used in semiconductors, which an influential Chinese policy adviser warned was ""just a start"".Vietnam has the second-largest rare-earth deposits, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. But they have remained largely untapped, with investment discouraged by low prices that are effectively set by China because of its near-monopoly on the global market. Visiting Hanoi this month to upgrade bilateral relations, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an agreement to boost Vietnam's ability to lure investors for its rare-earth reserves.In interviews with Reuters, 12 industry executives, investors, analysts and foreign officials described plans for Vietnam, including investments they said showed how talk of derisking supply chains to reduce reliance on China is translating into action. Some acknowledged the difficulties of forging a rare-earths hub but said the gambit could make Vietnam a viable player while assuaging strategic worries, even if China remained dominant.Kutscher said Blackstone's investment in the project would be worth around $100 million if it wins. She added that the company was talking to potential clients, including electric car makers VinFast (NASDAQ:VFS) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), about possible contracts with set prices that would shield suppliers from fluctuations and guarantee buyers a secure supply chain.Sealing such deals would address a hurdle faced by developers in Vietnam. In recent years, Japanese investors  Toyota  (NYSE:TM) Tsusho and Sojitz abandoned projects at Dong Pao after China ramped up supply, pummelling prices. The Japanese firms did not respond to requests for comment.Yet despite the focus on derisking, it is unclear whether clients would be ready to pay a premium for Vietnam, said Dylan Kelly, of investment firm Terra Capital, noting the market in general was opaque.Asked about VinFast's potential involvement, a spokesperson for parent company Vingroup said the group's entity in charge of raw-material procurement, VinES, had no current plans with Blackstone involving rare earths. He did not address subsequent questions about VinFast specifically.Rivian did not reply to a request for comment.RIVALLING MOUNTAIN PASSEffective exploitation of Dong Pao - which has sat dormant for at least seven years, according to an official at state-controlled miner Lavreco, which owns a concession - would propel Vietnam into the top league of rare-earths producers.But refining rare earths is complex, and China controls many processing technologies. Dong Pao's estimated deposits also need to be reassessed with modern methods, according to Blackstone.Still, rare earths at Dong Pao are relatively easy to access and are mostly concentrated in bastnaesite ores, according to the Hanoi University of Mining and Geology. These are typically rich in cerium, used in flat screens, and lanthanides, such as praseodymium and neodymium, which go into magnets.Tuan said VTRE hoped to win a concession that would allow it to extract about 10,000 metric tons of rare-earth oxide (REO) equivalent a year, roughly one-third of the mine's expected annual output. Production could start around the end of 2024, he said.That would put Dong Pao's output slightly below that of California's Mountain Pass, one of the world's largest mines, which produced 43,000 metric tons of REO equivalent in 2022, according to the USGS.Vietnam also plans to develop additional mines. In July, Hanoi set a target to produce up to 60,000 tons of REO equivalent a year by 2030. China set a domestic quota of 210,000 tons last year.Those goals would see Vietnam producing 5% to 15% of China's projected output by the decade's end, said David Merriman, a research analyst at consultancy Project Blue, who expects China to increase production over that period. Vietnam's targets were ""ambitious, though they are not entirely out of the question"", he said.U.S. ENCOURAGEMENT The U.S. agreed during Biden's visit to help Vietnam better map its rare-earths resources and ""attract quality investment"", according to a White House fact sheet, a move that could encourage U.S. investors to bid for Vietnam's new concessions.Reuters could not determine whether concrete plans involving U.S. investors exist at this stage. Officials at the U.S. embassy in Hanoi, the White House and Department of Commerce did not reply to requests for comment. But recent U.S. attempts to gain a foothold in the Vietnamese industry did not succeed, said John Rockhold, a consultant to the rare-earths sector and president of the Hanoi chapter of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, adding that one such plan involving VTRE collapsed this year. That plan would have involved the shipment to the U.S. of rare earths refined by VTRE and possible future investment in Vietnam of $200 million, according to a non-public report for unspecified U.S. investors seen by Reuters. VTRE confirmed the shipment deal had foundered.Instead, VTRE in April announced a deal to supply 100 metric tons of rare-earth oxides this year to Australian Strategic Materials. ASM declined to comment on Dong Pao's exploitation.Blackstone, which is a partner in that deal, operates a nickel mine in Vietnam and has determined that its processing facility in the country could handle ore from Dong Pao, according to a company statement.FROM ORE TO MAGNETUltimately, VTRE plans to play a role in the whole rare-earth industry from ore extraction to the final products, said Tuan, who with his wife owns most VTRE shares, according to a list of shareholders he showed to Reuters. Blackstone said the ownership information accorded with its assessment following due diligence.This is not an easy feat. The U.S. currently exports its rare-earth ores to China for processing as it lacks its own facilities.An existing VTRE factory in northern Vietnam specialises in separating rare-earth oxides from the extracted ore. The plant has capacity to process 5,000 tons of REO a year but the company plans to treble that to accommodate input from Dong Pao, Tuan said.Once separated, oxides are turned into metals for use in magnets and other industrial applications. The metallization process is controlled by China, which produces 90% of rare-earth metals, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.But VTRE is running a pilot project to build a metallization factory with South Korea's Setopia, said Setopia, which has no previous experience in the sector.The initial combined investment would be around $4 million, mostly from Setopia, a Setopia official told Reuters, with a plant possibly ready next year.In the downstream industry, South Korean and Chinese magnet firms are set to open factories in Vietnam, Reuters reported in August.Dudley Kingsnorth, a professor at the Western Australian School of Mines at Curtin University, said Vietnam had some way to go, including in improving environmental practices, to realise its rare-earth goals.Still, he said, Vietnam ""has the resources, the mining and processing expertise to provide alternatives to China"".

147,Tesla's Saudi Arabia expansion rumors dispelled by Musk: This week in EVs ,2023-09-24 00:02:00-04:00," -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap of the past week's biggest headlines in the electric vehicle space: Elon Musk claims WSJ report ‘utterly false’; VinFast posts impressive results; and EVs are taking over EU.Get news like this in real time by signing up for InvestingPro.Conflicting reports have emerged this week regarding Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) potential expansion plans in Saudi Arabia. Initially, The Wall Street Journal reported that the EV giant was in preliminary discussions with Arab government about establishing a manufacturing facility in the country. Citing unnamed sources, the report highlighted potential challenges stemming from the complex relationship between Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, and Saudi officials, as well as Saudi Arabia's existing collaboration with electric vehicle competitor Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID).If a deal were to materialize, it could have a significant impact on Tesla's ambitious goal of selling 20 million vehicles annually by 2030, as Elon Musk has previously suggested. This objective might require around twelve additional manufacturing facilities worldwide. Currently, Tesla manufactures vehicles in the United States, China, and Germany, with plans to expand operations into Mexico.However, the story took an unexpected turn when Elon Musk himself took to his social media platform ""X"" to deny The Wall Street Journal's report. Musk dismissed the article as ""another utterly false article from the WSJ.""The Wall Street Journal had based its report on information from unnamed sources who acknowledged that the talks between Tesla and Saudi Arabia were still in their early stages and could potentially fall apart.Shares of TSLA reached a weekly high of $272.13 on Wednesday before ending the week down 8%.As always, InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Start your 7-day trial to get on board!Vietnamese automaker VinFast Auto (NASDAQ:VFS) is making significant strides. In its first quarterly report since going public in August, Vinfast announced a remarkable 131.2% increase in revenue. The company reported Q2 revenue of 7.95 trillion Vietnamese dong ($327 million) for the period ending on June 30th. This impressive growth can be attributed to a substantial surge in deliveries, with 9,535 vehicles delivered during the second quarter, marking a more than fivefold increase compared to the first quarter. In the first half of the year, Vinfast reported a total of 11,315 deliveries, showcasing its expanding presence in the electric vehicle market.Despite a history of losses, Vinfast achieved a valuation of approximately $85 billion upon its Wall Street debut, surpassing the valuations of U.S. automakers Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM). This valuation surge was fueled by increased delivery volume and reductions in research and development expenses, leading to a reduction in net loss from 13.65 trillion Vietnamese dong to 12.54 trillion Vietnamese dong.Additionally, Vinfast CEO Thuy Le revealed plans to send the first batch of electric vehicles to Europe later this year, following regulatory approval. Approximately 3,000 VF8 crossover vehicles will be shipped to France, Germany, and the Netherlands during the fourth quarter from VinFast's manufacturing facility in northern Vietnam.This marks a significant expansion, surpassing their previous target of delivering 700 vehicles by July of the previous year. The move into the European market is strategically timed, given the European Union's investigation into Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, potentially creating an opening for Vinfast.Shares of VFS ended the week down 3% to $15.63/sh.EVs made significant strides in the European market in August, with data released by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) revealing that slightly over 20% of all new cars purchased in the European Union were fully electric. This marked the first instance where EVs constituted more than a fifth of total sales, with close to 1 million fully-electric vehicles sold in the EU over the initial eight months of 2023.Volkswagen (OTC:VLKAF), Europe's leading car manufacturer, reported a notable 21.2% increase in sales for August, according to the ACEA. Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and Renault (OTC:RNLSY) also experienced sales growth, with increases of 6.4% and 22.3%, respectively.",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/teslas-saudi-arabia-expansion-rumors-dispelled-by-musk-this-week-in-evs-3181199#comments,investing.com,2023-09-22,"['tesla', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'expansion', 'rumor', 'dispel', 'musk', 'this', 'week', 'ev', 'here', 'weekly', 'pro', 'recap', 'past', 'week', 'big', 'headline', 'electric', 'vehicle', 'space', 'elon', 'musk', 'claim', 'wsj', 'report', 'utterly', 'false', 'vinfast', 'post', 'impressive', 'result', 'ev', 'take', 'news', 'like', 'real', 'time', 'sign', 'report', 'emerge', 'week', 'regard', 'tesla', 'nasdaq', 'tsla', 'potential', 'expansion', 'plan', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'initially', 'the', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'report', 'ev', 'giant', 'preliminary', 'discussion', 'arab', 'government', 'establish', 'manufacture', 'facility', 'country', 'citing', 'unnamed', 'source', 'report', 'highlight', 'potential', 'challenge', 'stem', 'complex', 'relationship', 'tesla', 'ceo', 'elon', 'musk', 'saudi', 'official', 'well', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'exist', 'collaboration', 'electric', 'vehicle', 'competitor', 'lucid', 'group', 'nasdaq', 'lcid', 'deal', 'materialize', 'could', 'significant', 'impact', 'tesla', 'ambitious', 'goal', 'sell', 'million', 'vehicle', 'annually', 'elon', 'musk', 'previously', 'suggest', 'this', 'objective', 'might', 'require', 'around', 'twelve', 'additional', 'manufacturing', 'facility', 'worldwide', 'currently', 'tesla', 'manufacture', 'vehicle', 'united', 'state', 'china', 'germany', 'plan', 'expand', 'operation', 'story', 'take', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'elon', 'musk', 'take', 'social', 'medium', 'platform', 'x', 'deny', 'the', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'report', 'musk', 'dismiss', 'article', 'another', 'utterly', 'false', 'article', 'wsj', 'the', 'wall', 'street', 'journal', 'base', 'report', 'information', 'unnamed', 'source', 'acknowledge', 'talk', 'tesla', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'still', 'early', 'stage', 'could', 'potentially', 'fall', 'tsla', 'reach', 'weekly', 'high', 'wednesday', 'end', 'week', 'always', 'investingpro', 'subscriber', 'get', 'news', 'first', 'start', 'trial', 'get', 'board', 'vietnamese', 'automaker', 'vinfast', 'auto', 'nasdaq', 'vfs', 'make', 'significant', 'stride', 'in', 'first', 'quarterly', 'report', 'since', 'go', 'public', 'august', 'vinfast', 'announce', 'remarkable', 'increase', 'revenue', 'the', 'company', 'report', 'revenue', 'trillion', 'vietnamese', 'dong', 'million', 'period', 'end', 'june', 'this', 'impressive', 'growth', 'attribute', 'substantial', 'surge', 'delivery', 'vehicle', 'deliver', 'second', 'quarter', 'mark', 'fivefold', 'increase', 'compare', 'first', 'quarter', 'in', 'first', 'half', 'year', 'vinfast', 'report', 'total', 'delivery', 'showcasing', 'expand', 'presence', 'electric', 'vehicle', 'history', 'loss', 'vinfast', 'achieve', 'valuation', 'approximately', 'billion', 'upon', 'wall', 'street', 'debut', 'surpass', 'valuation', 'automaker', 'ford', 'nyse', 'f', 'general', 'motor', 'nyse', 'gm', 'this', 'valuation', 'surge', 'fuel', 'increased', 'delivery', 'volume', 'reduction', 'research', 'development', 'expense', 'lead', 'reduction', 'net', 'loss', 'trillion', 'vietnamese', 'dong', 'trillion', 'vietnamese', 'vinfast', 'ceo', 'thuy', 'le', 'reveal', 'plan', 'send', 'first', 'batch', 'electric', 'vehicle', 'europe', 'later', 'year', 'follow', 'regulatory', 'approval', 'approximately', 'crossover', 'vehicle', 'ship', 'france', 'germany', 'netherlands', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'vinfast', 'manufacturing', 'facility', 'northern', 'mark', 'significant', 'expansion', 'surpass', 'previous', 'target', 'deliver', 'vehicle', 'july', 'previous', 'year', 'the', 'move', 'european', 'market', 'strategically', 'time', 'give', 'european', 'union', 'investigation', 'chinese', 'electric', 'vehicle', 'manufacturer', 'potentially', 'create', 'open', 'vfs', 'end', 'week', 'make', 'significant', 'stride', 'european', 'market', 'august', 'data', 'release', 'european', 'automobile', 'manufacturer', 'association', 'acea', 'reveal', 'slightly', 'new', 'car', 'purchase', 'european', 'union', 'fully', 'electric', 'this', 'mark', 'first', 'instance', 'ev', 'constitute', 'fifth', 'total', 'sale', 'close', 'million', 'vehicle', 'sell', 'eu', 'initial', 'eight', 'month', 'otc', 'vlkaf', 'europe', 'lead', 'car', 'manufacturer', 'report', 'notable', 'increase', 'sale', 'august', 'accord', 'acea', 'stellantis', 'nyse', 'stla', 'renault', 'otc', 'rnlsy', 'also', 'experience', 'sale', 'growth', 'increase', 'respectively']"
148,Ford offers Unifor wage increases up to 25% ,2023-09-23 05:26:00-04:00,") -Ford Motor has offered Canadian union Unifor wage increases of up to 25% in its tentative agreement, the union said on Saturday.The agreement provides a 10% wage increase for the first year followed by increases of 2% and 3% through the second and third year and a $10,000 productivity and quality bonus to all employees on the active roll of the company, Unifor said. The proposals also include an increase in the monthly basic benefit and special allowance in all class codes across defined benefit and hybrid pension plans and investments to help transition from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle production to electric vehicle (EV) assembly facilities. Unifor, which represents about 5,600 Canadian auto workers, on Friday said that its Ford (NYSE:F) leadership group has voted unanimously to support the tentative agreement.Ford is also in the midst of contract negotiations in the U.S. with a strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union at its at the automaker's Wayne, Michigan assembly plant.The UAW began strikes on Friday against 38 parts distribution centers across the United States at GM and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), extending its unprecedented, simultaneous strikes that began with one assembly plant each of the Detroit Three. The additional facilities added about 5,600 workers to the 12,700 already on strike.The UAW said on Friday that Ford had improved its contract offer, including boosting profit sharing and agreeing to let workers strike over plant closures but said the union still has ""serious issues"" with Ford and its workers would remain on strike at the automaker's Wayne, Michigan assembly plant. Unlike UAW, Unifor chose one of the Detroit Three as a ""target"" to negotiate with first - in this case, Ford - in a pattern bargaining tactic used to set the tone for subsequent deals with other companies.UAW President Shawn Fain said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:META) live event that by targeting distribution centers the strike becomes a nationwide event. He said he expected talks to continue through the weekend.The standoff is fueling worries about prolonged industrial action that could disrupt production and dent U.S. economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed significant support by Americans for the striking auto workers. U.S. President Joe Biden said in a social media post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he would come to Michigan on Tuesday ""to join the picket line and stand in solidarity with the men and women of UAW,"" while former President Donald Trump, who is seeking a new term, will be in Michigan on Wednesday to address auto workers, his campaign said.

In a brief statement, the WGA said the agreement was ""made possible by the enduring solidarity of WGA members and extraordinary support of our union siblings who joined us on the picket lines for over 146 days.""The WGA settlement, while a milestone, will not return Hollywood to work. The SAG-AFTRA actors' union remains on strike.Writers walked off the job on May 2 after negotiations reached an impasse over compensation, minimum staffing of writers' rooms, the use of artificial intelligence and residuals that reward writers for popular streaming shows, among other issues.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the trade group representing Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) and other major studios, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

While workers across the entertainment industry waited for word of the outcome, no agreement was announced as the strike reached its 144th day.The WGA said in a statement early on Saturday that the two sides would meet again on Saturday.Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) CEO Bob Iger, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) Co-CEO Ted Sarandos, Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) CEO David Zaslav and Donna Langley, chairman of Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA)'s NBCUniversal Studio Group, took part in the talks with the Writers Guild of America (WGA) for a third day. Representatives for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the studios, had no comment.While the two sides met, union members turned out in large numbers in response to an appeal from WGA negotiators on Thursday to flood picket lines outside the studios. In the crowd outside Netflix on Friday was ""Mad Men"" creator and writer Matthew Weiner, who like others voiced optimism that the recent talks signaled progress was being made.""I'm hopeful,"" Weiner said of the possibility that the strike could be coming to an end. ""I would like to go back to work and I would like to start mending these relationships."" Roughly 11,500 WGA members walked off the job in May, demanding higher pay and residuals in the streaming TV era plus limits around the use of artificial intelligence.Producer and WGA member Al Septien, also picketing outside Netflix on Friday, said he wanted to get back to work, but only under the right terms.""We've been out here a long time.

156,"GM, Stellantis dealers and customers face dwindling parts as UAW strike expands ",2023-09-23 02:02:00-04:00,") - U.S. auto workers expanded their strike on Friday with a clear target for distress: dealers who sell and service GM and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) vehicles. Selling and installing parts is one of the most profitable parts of the auto business, but it is also one of the most vulnerable, because the industry relies on just-in-time shipments. The strategy of choking parts delivery increases problems for some dealers who say it already had been difficult to source some components.""It's going to become near impossible to get a lot of these parts,"" said Richard Fasulo, a diagnostic technician from Wappinger, New York, who works for a Cadillac franchise dealer and used car dealers. The broader strike, which targets 38 parts distribution centers owned by GM and Stellantis, ""is going to have these shops telling their customers 'We don't know when we can fix your vehicle. It might be indefinitely.'""Selling repair parts and service returns is the key to many dealers' profits, and returns 40% or better gross profit margins for big auto retail chains such as AutoNation (NYSE:AN) and Lithia.""If your car doesn't work, you're just stuck. It's just mean, don't you think?"" said Howard Drake, a GM dealership owner based in California, describing the difficult situation for customers needing repairs. ""I thought the punishment would be in the form of adverse selection for customers with limited choice. I didn't think it would be my lot stacked up with cars that I can't fix because they won't man a parts distribution center,"" he said. National Association of Auto Dealers President and CEO Mike Stanton said: ""Dealers don't want to see anything to limit our potential to serve customers, so we certainly hope automakers and the UAW can reach an agreement quickly and amicably.""The UAW had been expected to expand their strike by shutting down plants that made the highest-profit vehicles, such as pickup trucks. But automakers have built up vehicle inventory and for many dealers problems with repairs will start soon.""It's definitely going to impact customers,"" said Thomas Morris, 60, who went on strike on Friday at a General Motors (NYSE:GM) parts distribution center in the suburbs of Philadelphia.The center serves GM dealerships from Pennsylvania to Maine, moving some 30,000 parts for auto repairs each day, workers said.GM said in a statement the company has ""contingency plans for various scenarios"" while Stellantis said it was awaiting a response from UAW to their ""competitive offer"" on Thursday and looking forward to a ""productive engagement"".Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the UAW had made a smart move.""I think it is a great strategy going after the distribution centers,"" he added.

157,Inflation slowdown provides relief to central banks in US and Eurozone ,2023-09-24 16:36:00-04:00,"Position added successfully to: 
Position added successfully to: 
Central banks in the United States and the Eurozone are expected to find some respite this week as key indicators point towards a deceleration in consumer-price growth, as reported on Sunday. The Federal Reserve's favored inflation measure, which excludes food and energy costs, is projected to have fallen below 4% in August for the first time in nearly two years. Simultaneously, the Eurozone's annual core price growth measure is anticipated to have dipped to a year-low of 4.8% in September.This slowdown could offer solace to officials from both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB). Last week, both institutions hinted that their monetary tightening phase might be concluding or at least temporarily paused, directing their attention towards maintaining high interest rates to effectively combat inflation.However, vigilance remains crucial. The potential for crude oil prices reaching $100 per barrel could trigger further price growth. Recent surges in energy costs are already being felt. The comprehensive personal consumption expenditures price index favored by the Fed is anticipated to record one of this year's highest monthly increases when Friday's report is released.Despite these hikes, headline inflation in the Eurozone, also due for release on Friday, is projected to have considerably weakened to a two-year low of 4.5%. In addition to these developments, appearances by heads of the Fed and ECB, along with interest rate decisions from Hungary and Mexico, will keep market participants engaged this week. In the U.S., the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report may be the last set of government figures policymakers see for some time due to an impending government shutdown beginning October 1. The previous shutdown in 2013 resulted in delays for key reports such as employment data.Other significant data releases scheduled this week include new-home sales, consumer sentiment and durable goods orders. Furthermore, the Census Bureau will release its third estimate of second-quarter growth along with benchmark revisions. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to host a town hall with educators, while Fed officials Neel Kashkari, Austan Goolsbee, Thomas Barkin and John Williams are scheduled to speak at separate events.Meanwhile, in Canada, July's gross domestic product data will be released following preliminary data that suggested a stagnant economy for the month. This aligns with the central bank's decision to maintain interest rates at 5%. The forthcoming payroll and job vacancy data is expected to indicate a relaxing labor market, though wage growth continues to be robust.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

158,"Asian stocks dip, China slides on property market jitters ",2023-09-24 18:15:00-04:00,"-- Most Asian stocks retreated on Monday as markets digested the outlook for higher interest rates in developed markets, while Chinese shares led losses amid persistent concerns over a property market crisis.Most regional stocks were nursing steep losses from the prior week after the Federal Reserve warned U.S. could rise further, and are likely to remain higher for longer. The outlook dented most risk-driven assets, and is set to dampen regional markets in the coming months. Sentiment was also on edge before a string of key regional economic readings this week.Renewed concerns over China also weighed, especially after embattled real estate developer China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333) said it will be unable to issue new debt due to an ongoing government investigation into its unit Hengda Real Estate Group. News of the investigation had fueled fears of a broader government crackdown on the property sector, which is grappling with a brewing debt crisis.The property developer’s shares tumbled nearly 25% in Hong Kong trade, also sparking losses in other real estate stocks. Country Garden Services  (HK:6098) and Longfor Properties Co Ltd (HK:0960) slid about 3% each, dragging Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index down more than 1%. China’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes lost  between 0.3% and 0.5%. Chinese stocks have seen increased volatility this year, as markets weighed worsening economic conditions against bets that the government will roll out more stimulus measures to support growth.But sentiment has worsened in recent months, especially given Beijing’s conservative approach to more stimulus. Concerns over a meltdown in the property sector have also kept sentiment towards the country on edge.Focus this week is now on purchasing managers’ index data for September, which is expected to shed more light on business activity. While the manufacturing sector saw some improvement in August, service sector activity appeared to be deteriorating.Concerns over China spilled over into broader Asian markets. Australia’s ASX 200 fell 0.4%, with a reading on Australian consumer price index (CPI) inflation due this week.South Korea’s KOSPI sank 0.6%, while futures for India’s Nifty 50 index pointed to a positive open after the index plummeted from record highs last week.Japan’s Nikkei 225 and TOPIX were the key outliers for the day, rising 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively.Local stocks reversed most losses from Friday after the Bank of Japan said it had no plans to scale back its monetary stimulus policies in the near-term, heralding continued support for the Japanese economy and stocks.A dovish BOJ has been one of the key drivers of a Japanese stock rally this year, with the Nikkei and the TOPIX trading just shy of a 33-year peak.Focus this week is on Tokyo inflation data for September, due on Friday.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 dipped below its 100-day moving average - a key support level - for the first time since March, Its failure to break above that level suggests the index is still under downward pressure.""This week is about some Fed messaging colliding with overly optimistic equity investors,"" said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments in Charlotte, North Carolina. Hill added that investors have ""wanted to trade peak interest rates for almost a year now."" But he said it was clear in remarks this week by Fed Chair Jerome Powell ""and in the dot plot that the Fed doesn't think we’re there yet.""""This week’s stock action has been about digesting that reality.""Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields retreated from 16-year highs as investors turned their focus from hawkish Fed guidance to key economic data waiting in the wings.Investors were still digesting the Fed's decision to let its key interest rate stand, but update its quarterly Summary Economic Projections to suggest restrictive monetary policy will remain in place longer than previously anticipated.On Friday, remarks from Fed Governor Michelle Bowman supported the FOMC hawks, suggesting the Fed funds target rate should be raised further and held ""at a restrictive level for some time"" to bring inflation down to the central bank's 2% target. ""There are a lot of factors working against a soft landing and that’s something the Fed needs to be reminded of, because pushing rates higher could push us into recession,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 106.58 points, or 0.31%, to 33,963.84, the S&P 500 lost 9.94 points, or 0.23%, to 4,320.06 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.18 points, or 0.09%, to 13,211.81.Among the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, consumer discretionary suffered the steepest percentage loss, while tech and energy were the only gainers. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co gained 1.9% after the striking United Auto Workers union reported progress in talks with the automaker.Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) added 1.7% in the wake Britain's antitrust regulator's statement that  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s restructured $69 billion acquisition of the company by ""opens the door"" to the biggest-ever gaming deal being cleared.U.S.-listed shares of Chinese firms including PDD Holdings, JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, Li Auto and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) rose between 2% and 4% on signs of an economic a rebound, while  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) jumped 5.0% after Bloomberg reported that report the company's logistics arm Cainiao was planning to file for a Hong Kong IPO as soon as next week.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.29-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 35 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 33 new highs and 321 new lows.

160,Tyson and Perdue face child labor investigations - New York Times ,2023-09-23 08:29:00-04:00,") - The U.S. Department of Labor has opened investigations into meat companies  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) and Perdue Farms to determine whether migrant children were used to clean slaughterhouses, the New York Times reported on Saturday. The Labor Department opened the investigations after a New York Times Magazine article this week showed migrant children working overnight shifts for contractors in the companies' plants on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, the report said.Reuters was not able to independently verify the details of the Times report. The Labor Department and Tyson Foods did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.A Perdue spokesperson said the company had not been notified of the investigation but planned to cooperate fully with any government inquiry on the matter. ""We are conducting a comprehensive third-party audit of child labor prevention and protection procedures including a compliance audit of contractors,"" Purdue's spokesperson said.The Labor Department has also opened investigations into Fayette Industrial and QSI that run cleaning shifts for Perdue and Tyson respectively, the newspaper said. QSI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Fayette Industrial could not immediately be reached for comment. In April the Biden administration sent a letter to meat companies including Tyson and Perdue asking the companies to examine their supply chains for evidence of child labor.The letter was part of an effort by several agencies, led by the Labor Department, to curb the use of illegal child labor across sectors.

(NYSE:BRDS), a leading provider of environmentally friendly electric transportation, has been served with a notice from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) regarding the suspension of trading and commencement of delisting proceedings for the company's Class A common stock. The action, set to take effect at the start of business on September 25, 2023, comes in response to Bird's failure to meet an NYSE listing requirement for a market cap exceeding $15 million over a consecutive 30-day period.Despite the impending suspension, Bird maintains that its current market cap does not accurately represent the intrinsic value of the business and has announced plans to appeal the NYSE's determination. If successful, trading of Bird's Class A common stock on the NYSE will resume. In the meantime, Bird's Class A common stock intends to trade on the OTC exchange operated by OTC Markets Group Inc., starting next week.Bird's interim CEO, Michael Washinushi, expressed disappointment at the change in NYSE listing status but reaffirmed the company's commitment to shareholders, employees, partners, and associated cities and institutions. He emphasized that Bird's fundamentals remain strong and that the recent acquisition of Spin has bolstered its prospects.Earlier this year, Bird initiated a multi-step plan aimed at enhancing financial and operational performance. The plan involved leadership and operational restructuring as well as various cost-saving initiatives. John Bitove, Chair of Bird's Board of Directors, stated these steps were crucial in facilitating Bird's strategic acquisition of Spin. He believes this move is pivotal in making the company cash flow positive and generating more value for its stockholders in the long term.

162,UK competition authority provisionally approves Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard ,2023-09-24 17:39:00-04:00,"The United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provided provisional approval on Monday for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s restructured acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI). The announcement was well-received by the UK's merger and acquisition sector, following previous approvals from the U.S. and E.U. The $68.7 billion deal, with Microsoft's offer standing at $95 per share, led to a roughly 2% increase in Activision Blizzard's stock, bringing it closer to the acquisition offer.The approval by the CMA is contingent on the transfer of cloud gaming rights to French video game publisher UbiSoft Entertainment. Over the next 15 years, Ubisoft will hold all of Activision Blizzard's cloud gaming rights, preventing Microsoft from exclusively releasing games on its Xbox Cloud. Notably, these rights include the Call of Duty brand, for which Ubisoft will compensate Microsoft with a one-time payment based on usage.Microsoft's shares remained virtually unchanged after the announcement. However, the tech giant has seen a year-to-date performance increase of 33%, surpassing both Activision Blizzard's 23% increase and broader indices.The proposed takeover could significantly boost Microsoft's growth prospects. Sales forecasts indicate a rise of 10% in fiscal 2024 to $233.80 billion for Microsoft, while Activision Blizzard sales are expected to jump 13% this year to $9.66 billion. This could potentially add nearly $10 billion in revenue to Microsoft, marking a 70% growth increase over the last five years from sales of $143.01 billion in fiscal 2020.This rate of growth would outpace Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s 47% sales growth over the same period. Apple currently holds the largest market cap on U.S. stock exchanges, just ahead of Microsoft. Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard has experienced a 49% increase in sales since 2019, surpassing Apple’s top-line expansion rate, suggesting a significant potential for compounded growth for Microsoft.In terms of earnings, Microsoft's bottom line is projected to rise 11% in FY24 and leap another 14% in FY25 to $12.42 per share. Microsoft's stock trades at 29.3X forward earnings, above the S&P 500's 20.2X, but mostly on par with the computer-software industry average. Activision Blizzard's annual earnings are expected to climb 23% this year and rise another 4% in FY24 at $4.37 per share. The game developer's stock trades at a 21.9X forward earnings multiple, closer to the industry benchmark.The potential deal between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard appears promising for both parties. The long-term benefits are expected to favor Microsoft, while Activision Blizzard edges closer to its acquisition price.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

164,Armenian PM blames Russia for failing to ensure security | Reuters,2023-09-24 12:48:00-04:00,") - Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said on Sunday the likelihood was rising that ethnic Armenians would flee the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh and blamed Russia for failing to ensure Armenian security.If 120,000 people go down the Lachin corridor to Armenia, the small South Caucasian country could face both a humanitarian and political crisis.""If proper conditions are not created for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their homes and there are no effective protection mechanisms against ethnic cleansing, the likelihood is rising that the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh will see exile from their homeland as the only way to save their lives and identity,"" Pashinyan said in address to the nation.""Responsibility for such a development of events will fall entirely on Azerbaijan, which adopted a policy of ethnic cleansing, and on the Russian peacekeeping contingent in Nagorno-Karabakh,"" he said, according to a government transcript.He added that the Armenian-Russian strategic partnership was ""not enough to ensure the external security of Armenia"".Last week, Azerbaijan scored a victory over ethnic Armenians who have controlled the Karabakh region since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. An adviser to the leader of the Karabakh Armenians told Reuters earlier on Sunday that the population would leave because they feel unsafe under Azerbaijani rule.Russia had acted as guarantor for a peace deal that ended a 44-day war in Karabakh three years ago, and many Armenians blame Moscow for failing to protect the region.Russian officials say Pashinyan is to blame for his own mishandling of the crisis, and have repeatedly said that Armenia, which borders Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan and Georgia, has few other friends in the region.""The government will accept our brothers and sisters from Nagorno-Karabakh with full care,"" Pashinyan said.Pashinyan has warned that some unidentified forces were seeking to stoke a coup against him and has accused Russian media of engaging in an information war against him.""Some of our partners are increasingly making efforts to expose our security vulnerabilities, putting at risk not only our external, but also internal security and stability, while violating all norms of etiquette and correctness in diplomatic and interstate relations, including obligations assumed under treaties,"" Pashinyan said in his Sunday address.""In this context, it is necessary to transform, complement and enrich the external and internal security instruments of the Republic of Armenia,"" he said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/armenia-azerbaijan-pashinyan/armenian-pm-says-armenians-may-flee-karabakh-and-blames-russia-idUSKBN30U03R,reuters,2023-09-22,"['armenian', 'pm', 'blame', 'russia', 'fail', 'ensure', 'security', 'reuters', 'armenia', 'prime', 'minister', 'nikol', 'pashinyan', 'say', 'sunday', 'likelihood', 'rise', 'ethnic', 'armenian', 'would', 'flee', 'breakaway', 'region', 'blame', 'russia', 'fail', 'ensure', 'armenian', 'people', 'go', 'lachin', 'corridor', 'armenia', 'small', 'south', 'caucasian', 'country', 'could', 'face', 'humanitarian', 'political', 'crisis', 'if', 'proper', 'condition', 'create', 'armenian', 'live', 'home', 'effective', 'protection', 'mechanism', 'ethnic', 'cleanse', 'likelihood', 'rise', 'armenian', 'see', 'exile', 'homeland', 'way', 'save', 'live', 'identity', 'pashinyan', 'say', 'address', 'nation', 'responsibility', 'development', 'event', 'fall', 'entirely', 'azerbaijan', 'adopt', 'policy', 'ethnic', 'cleanse', 'russian', 'peacekeeping', 'contingent', 'say', 'accord', 'government', 'add', 'strategic', 'partnership', 'enough', 'ensure', 'external', 'security', 'armenia', 'week', 'azerbaijan', 'score', 'victory', 'ethnic', 'armenian', 'control', 'karabakh', 'region', 'since', 'dissolution', 'soviet', 'union', 'an', 'adviser', 'leader', 'karabakh', 'armenian', 'tell', 'reuters', 'earlier', 'sunday', 'population', 'would', 'leave', 'feel', 'unsafe', 'azerbaijani', 'act', 'guarantor', 'peace', 'deal', 'end', 'war', 'karabakh', 'three', 'year', 'ago', 'many', 'armenian', 'blame', 'moscow', 'fail', 'protect', 'official', 'say', 'pashinyan', 'blame', 'mishandle', 'crisis', 'repeatedly', 'say', 'armenia', 'border', 'turkey', 'iran', 'azerbaijan', 'georgia', 'friends', 'region', 'the', 'government', 'accept', 'brother', 'sister', 'full', 'care', 'pashinyan', 'warn', 'unidentified', 'force', 'seek', 'stoke', 'coup', 'accuse', 'russian', 'medium', 'engage', 'information', 'war', 'some', 'partner', 'increasingly', 'make', 'effort', 'expose', 'security', 'vulnerability', 'put', 'risk', 'external', 'also', 'internal', 'security', 'stability', 'violate', 'norm', 'etiquette', 'correctness', 'diplomatic', 'interstate', 'relation', 'include', 'obligation', 'assume', 'treaty', 'pashinyan', 'say', 'sunday', 'address', 'in', 'context', 'necessary', 'transform', 'complement', 'enrich', 'external', 'internal', 'security', 'instrument', 'republic', 'armenia', 'say']"
165,"Israeli forces kill two Palestinians in West Bank raid, Hamas, emergency workers say | Reuters",2023-09-24 12:16:00-04:00,") - Israeli forces killed two Palestinians, including a fighter of the Islamist Hamas group, during a raid on a refugee camp in the West Bank on Sunday, emergency workers and Hamas said, while in Gaza Israeli strikes hit security posts for a second day.In the latest round of violence, Israeli forces raided the Nur Shams camp near the West Bank city of Tulkarm in the early hours of Sunday morning, setting off an hours-long gun battle with Palestinian fighters, witnesses said.The Israeli military said it conducted ""counterterrorism activity"" in the camp, dismantling an operational command centre equipped with computers and surveillance cameras and uncovering dozens of explosive devices and bomb-making components.""During the activity, suspects opened fire and hurled explosive devices at the forces, who responded with live fire. Hits were identified,"" the military said in a statement, adding that an Israeli soldier was moderately wounded.Hamas, which has been extending its reach away from its base in Gaza and into the West Bank, said one of the men who were killed, 21-year-old Osaid Abu Ali, was a member of its armed wing.The family of the other man, 32-year-old Abdel-Rahman Abu Daghash, said he had stepped on to the roof of his house to observe what was going on when he was killed by a sniper.""He went up to the rooftop to film the ambulances. He barely had the chance to look and the sniper targeted him,"" said his brother Mo'men Abu Daghash. ""He has nothing to do with it and he has kids and his wife is about to give birth.""There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.Violence in the West Bank has raged for more than a year, with stepped-up Israeli military raids, increased settler assaults on Palestinian villages, and a spate of Palestinian attacks on Israelis.In the Nur Shams camp, residents took stock of rubble-strewn roads and buildings damaged during an operation that witnesses said lasted around six hours.The military said special engineering vehicles dug up roads in the camp, uncovering a large number of concealed bombs and setting off at least one roadside bomb.For much of the year, the turmoil in the West Bank has overshadowed the situation in Gaza, the blockaded coastal enclave run by Hamas, but in recent days groups of youths have held violent protests along the separation fence, throwing stones and improvised explosives and launching incendiary balloons towards Israel.On Sunday, at least five Palestinians were wounded in clashes with Israeli forces, the health ministry said.By late afternoon, the Israeli military said it conducted a second day of strikes against Hamas checkpoints in Gaza close to where rioters threw an explosive device towards its soldiers. There was no word on any casualties.In a separate incident, the Israeli military said it had detained eight students from Bir Zeit University in the West bank whom it described as wanted suspects linked to Hamas, and whom it said planned to carry out an attack in the immediate future.",https://www.reuters.com/article/israel-palestinians/israeli-forces-kill-two-palestinians-in-west-bank-raid-hamas-emergency-workers-idUSKBN30U02D,reuters,2023-09-22,"['israeli', 'force', 'kill', 'two', 'palestinian', 'west', 'bank', 'raid', 'hamas', 'emergency', 'worker', 'say', 'reuters', 'israeli', 'force', 'kill', 'two', 'palestinian', 'include', 'fighter', 'islamist', 'hamas', 'group', 'raid', 'refugee', 'camp', 'west', 'bank', 'sunday', 'emergency', 'worker', 'hamas', 'say', 'gaza', 'israeli', 'strike', 'hit', 'security', 'post', 'second', 'late', 'round', 'violence', 'israeli', 'force', 'raid', 'nur', 'sham', 'camp', 'near', 'west', 'bank', 'city', 'tulkarm', 'early', 'hour', 'sunday', 'morning', 'set', 'gun', 'battle', 'palestinian', 'fighter', 'witness', 'israeli', 'military', 'say', 'conducted', 'counterterrorism', 'activity', 'camp', 'dismantle', 'operational', 'command', 'centre', 'equip', 'computer', 'surveillance', 'camera', 'uncover', 'dozen', 'explosive', 'device', 'component', 'during', 'activity', 'suspect', 'open', 'fire', 'hurl', 'explosive', 'device', 'force', 'respond', 'live', 'fire', 'hit', 'identify', 'military', 'say', 'statement', 'add', 'israeli', 'soldier', 'moderately', 'extend', 'reach', 'away', 'base', 'gaza', 'west', 'bank', 'say', 'one', 'men', 'kill', 'osaid', 'abu', 'ali', 'member', 'arm', 'family', 'man', 'abu', 'daghash', 'say', 'stepped', 'roof', 'house', 'observe', 'go', 'kill', 'sniper', 'he', 'go', 'rooftop', 'film', 'ambulance', 'he', 'barely', 'chance', 'look', 'sniper', 'target', 'say', 'brother', 'abu', 'daghash', 'he', 'nothing', 'kid', 'wife', 'give', 'birth', 'there', 'immediate', 'comment', 'israeli', 'west', 'bank', 'rag', 'year', 'israeli', 'military', 'raid', 'increase', 'settler', 'assault', 'palestinian', 'village', 'spate', 'palestinian', 'attack', 'nur', 'sham', 'camp', 'resident', 'take', 'stock', 'road', 'building', 'damage', 'operation', 'witness', 'say', 'last', 'around', 'six', 'military', 'say', 'special', 'engineering', 'vehicle', 'dig', 'road', 'camp', 'uncover', 'large', 'number', 'conceal', 'bombs', 'set', 'least', 'one', 'roadside', 'much', 'year', 'turmoil', 'west', 'bank', 'overshadow', 'situation', 'gaza', 'blockade', 'coastal', 'enclave', 'run', 'hamas', 'recent', 'day', 'group', 'youth', 'hold', 'violent', 'protest', 'along', 'separation', 'fence', 'throw', 'stone', 'improvise', 'explosive', 'launch', 'incendiary', 'balloon', 'towards', 'sunday', 'least', 'five', 'palestinian', 'wound', 'clash', 'israeli', 'force', 'health', 'ministry', 'late', 'afternoon', 'israeli', 'military', 'say', 'conducted', 'second', 'day', 'strike', 'hamas', 'checkpoint', 'gaza', 'close', 'rioter', 'throw', 'explosive', 'device', 'towards', 'soldier', 'there', 'word', 'separate', 'incident', 'israeli', 'military', 'say', 'detain', 'eight', 'student', 'bir', 'zeit', 'university', 'west', 'bank', 'describe', 'wanted', 'suspect', 'link', 'hamas', 'say', 'plan', 'carry', 'attack', 'immediate', 'future']"
166,"El Paso, Texas 'at a breaking point' amid jump in migration, mayor says | Reuters",2023-09-24 19:34:00-04:00,") - The dramatic increase in migrants crossing the U.S. border from Mexico has pushed the city of El Paso, Texas, to ""a breaking point,"" with more than 2,000 people per day seeking asylum, exceeding shelter capacity and straining resources, its mayor said on Saturday.""The city of El Paso only has so many resources and we have come to ... a breaking point right now,"" Mayor Oscar Leeser said at a news conference.The arrival of largely Venezuelan asylum seekers is part of a larger swell of immigrants who traveled dangerous routes on buses and cargo trains to Mexican border towns near San Diego, California, and the Texas cities of El Paso and Eagle Pass.Migrant numbers had plummeted in recent months, and the recent rise has generated a new wave of political attacks on U.S. President Joe Biden heading into the 2024 election.Lesser said El Paso plans to open a new shelter, and on Saturday chartered five buses to take migrants to New York, Chicago and Denver.Republican governors in Texas and Florida have been criticized for sending migrants to cities perceived as liberal such as New York and Sacramento. But Leeser, a Democrat, said all of the migrants on the El Paso buses were going voluntarily to the cities of their choice.Leeser said the Biden had been a good partner. But he said the overall U.S. immigration system was broken.Many migrants from Venezuela, he said, lacked transportation to their desired destinations, while El Paso's current shelter houses only 400 people, and must also be available to help the homeless.As recently as six weeks ago, about 350 to 400 people were crossing into El Paso per day, but the past few days have brought 2,000 or more.Over the past 10 days, the city has worked with the U.S. Border Patrol to provide shelter for 6,500 people, Leeser said.About two-thirds of those crossing into El Paso currently are single men, he said. About 32% are families and just 2% are unaccompanied children.""I think it's really important to note that we have a broken immigration system,"" he said.

167,"Fleeing bombs and death, Armenians recount  fear and hunger | Reuters",2023-09-24 13:51:00-04:00,") - After the village was bombed so hard there was no way to bury the truckloads of dead, he fled with his family and stuffed whatever possessions could be salvaged into two vans.Petya Grigoryan is one of the first ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to make it to Armenia after a lightning 24-hour Azerbaijani military operation defeated the Karabakh Armenian forces.The ethnic Armenians of Karabakh, internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, say they will not live as part of Azerbaijan and that almost all of the 120,000 Armenians there will leave for Armenia.So far several hundred have reached Armenia.Grigoryan, a 69-year-old driver, said his Kochoghot village in what the Armenians know as the Martakert district of Karabakh was pummelled by Azerbaijan armed forces. There were two KAMAZ-truckloads full of civilian dead in the village, he said.""There was nowhere to bury them,"" Grigoryan told Reuters after making his way down the Lachin corridor and across the border into Armenia, where Reuters interviewed him and other refugees in the border town of Goris.""We took what we could and left. We don’t know where we’re going. We have nowhere to go,"" he said.Of the 500 villagers, he said 40 had got out.Reuters was unable to independently verify his account but it chimed with the outline given by other ethnic Armenians fleeing Karabakh, which Azerbaijan says will be turned into a ""paradise"" and fully integrated.Azerbaijan said it launched the operation against Karabakh forces after attacks on its own citizens. President Ilham Aliyev said his army had only targeted Karabakh fighters and that civilians had been protected.""Before the operation, I once again gave a strict order to all our military units that the Armenian population living in the Karabakh region should not be affected by the anti-terrorist measures and that the civilian population be protected,"" he said in an address to the nation on Sept. 20.""Civilians felt protected entirely thanks to the professionalism of our armed forces,"" he said.Grigoryan and thousands of other Armenians made their way to the airport near the Karabakh capital, known as Stepanakert by Armenians and Khankendi by Azerbaijan, where some Russian peacekeepers are based.""It was scary there,"" he said. Thousands slept on the ground without food and little water.

168,"40,000 march in Spain against amnesty for Catalan separatists | Reuters",2023-09-24 12:15:00-04:00,") - Tens of thousands of Spaniards protested in Madrid on Sunday against possible plans by acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to grant an amnesty to Catalan separatists to keep himself in office after an election he failed to win.Waving Spanish flags, supporters of the opposition conservative People's Party (PP) travelled from across Spain to attend the rally in Madrid. Authorities estimated the size of the crowd at 40,000.Sanchez, who came second in an election in July, could stay in office if he wins the support of exiled former Catalonia leader Carles Puigdemont, whose Junts per Catalunya party controls seven seats in parliament.Puigdemont, wanted in Spain for attempting the region's secession, has demanded that legal action be dropped against fellow separatists as a condition for his support.Alberto Nunez Feijoo, leader of the PP which won the most votes on July 23, said he would never concede to demands for an amnesty for organisers of a 2017 independence referendum in Catalonia, which was held despite courts ruling it was illegal.Withdrawing criminal cases against the separatists would amount to granting an amnesty to ""coup plotters"", he told supporters at the Madrid rally.Gregorio Casteneda, 72, a pensioner, had travelled from Santander on Spain's north coast to show his opposition to any amnesty.""I am not in favour of the government that we have. To me this is a disaster because it is going to divide Spain totally,"" he told Reuters.Sanchez held his own political rally in Gava, near Catalonia's regional capital Barcelona, on Sunday. He did not mention an amnesty but said the Socialists wanted to heal social divisions over the Catalan crisis.""We are trying to turn the page,"" he told supporters.In 2021, Sanchez granted pardons to nine separatists jailed over their roles in the independence push.Feijoo will take the first stab at a vote to become prime minister on Sept. 27, but his chances of winning are seen as slim since the PP opposes any concessions to separatists. If Feijoo fails, Sanchez will get a chance to see if he can muster support.",https://www.reuters.com/article/spain-politics-protest/40000-march-in-spain-against-amnesty-for-catalan-separatists-idUSKBN30U06O,reuters,2023-09-22,"['march', 'spain', 'amnesty', 'catalan', 'separatists', 'reuters', 'ten', 'thousand', 'spaniard', 'protest', 'madrid', 'sunday', 'possible', 'plan', 'act', 'prime', 'minister', 'pedro', 'sanchez', 'grant', 'amnesty', 'catalan', 'separatists', 'keep', 'office', 'election', 'fail', 'spanish', 'flag', 'supporter', 'opposition', 'conservative', 'people', 'party', 'pp', 'travel', 'across', 'spain', 'attend', 'rally', 'madrid', 'authority', 'estimate', 'size', 'crowd', 'come', 'second', 'election', 'july', 'could', 'stay', 'office', 'win', 'support', 'exile', 'former', 'catalonia', 'leader', 'carles', 'puigdemont', 'whose', 'junts', 'per', 'catalunya', 'party', 'control', 'seven', 'seat', 'want', 'spain', 'attempt', 'region', 'secession', 'demand', 'legal', 'action', 'drop', 'fellow', 'separatist', 'condition', 'nunez', 'feijoo', 'leader', 'pp', 'vote', 'july', 'say', 'would', 'never', 'concede', 'demand', 'amnesty', 'organiser', 'independence', 'referendum', 'catalonia', 'hold', 'despite', 'court', 'rule', 'criminal', 'case', 'separatist', 'would', 'amount', 'grant', 'amnesty', 'coup', 'plotter', 'tell', 'supporter', 'madrid', 'casteneda', 'pensioner', 'travel', 'santander', 'spain', 'north', 'coast', 'show', 'opposition', 'amnesty', 'i', 'favour', 'government', 'to', 'disaster', 'go', 'divide', 'spain', 'totally', 'tell', 'hold', 'political', 'rally', 'gava', 'near', 'catalonia', 'regional', 'capital', 'barcelona', 'sunday', 'he', 'mention', 'amnesty', 'say', 'socialist', 'want', 'heal', 'social', 'division', 'catalan', 'crisis', 'we', 'try', 'turn', 'page', 'tell', 'sanchez', 'grant', 'pardon', 'nine', 'separatist', 'jail', 'role', 'independence', 'take', 'first', 'stab', 'vote', 'become', 'prime', 'minister', 'chance', 'win', 'see', 'slim', 'since', 'pp', 'oppose', 'concession', 'separatist', 'if', 'feijoo', 'fail', 'sanchez', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'muster', 'support']"

170,Republicans appeal to far right to avert US government shutdown | Reuters,2023-09-24 18:08:00-04:00,") - With just a week before Washington runs out of money to keep the federal government fully operating, warring factions within the Republican Party in the U.S. Congress on Sunday showed no signs of coming together to pass a stopgap funding bill.Congress so far has failed to finish any of the 12 regular spending bills to fund federal agency programs in the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1.House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy will push an ambitious plan this week to win approval of four large bills, including military and homeland security funding, that he hopes would demonstrate enough progress to far-right Republicans to win their support for a stop-gap spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, or CR, as well.Republican Representative Michael McCaul, a 19-year veteran of Congress who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, urged the group of party ""holdouts"" to stop blocking Republican-backed spending bills while at the same time ""saying don't bring bipartisan bills to the floor.""""Republicans need to vote for Republican bills"" to avert a shutdown, McCaul said on ABC's ""This Week"" broadcast.But some of those ""holdouts,"" who want deep spending cuts that go beyond a deal passed earlier this year, showed no sign of relenting.""Continuing resolutions don't solve the problem. They just kick the can down the road,"" Republican Representative Tony Gonzalez told CBS News' ""Face the Nation.""In June, President Joe Biden signed into law an increase in U.S. borrowing authority that he brokered with McCarthy, which also came with around $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years.Ultra-right House Republicans want to go further with around $120 billion in additional cuts just for the new fiscal year, which could hit programs ranging from education and environmental protection to Internal Revenue Service enforcement and medical research.Similarly, Republican Representative Tim Burchett told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he has never voted for a temporary funding bill and won't this time around.He warned that if McCarthy allows legislation to pass the House with Democratic support, ""I would look strongly at"" a move to strip McCarthy of his speakership.""This dysfunctional Washington cannot continue,"" Burchett said, referring to the way Congress handles the federal budget, which is on a path to a $1.5 trillion deficit for the fiscal year that ends on Saturday.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg warned in an ABC interview that a government shutdown will require his agency to immediately suspend air traffic controller training courses at a time when air travel is ""getting back to normal"" following a high volume of flight delays and disruptions last year.Aides to McCarthy were not immediately available for comment on whether negotiations over a CR were continuing on Sunday.But he has been pushing for a 30-day bill to keep federal offices open, coupled with a strict border security plan that would basically suspend most immigration into the United States at a time of record numbers of people seeking asylum on the border with Mexico.Even some of the Senate's most conservative Republicans on Sunday appealed to House counterparts to stop blocking a stop-gap bill.""We would like for the House to begin that process of sending us a CR to keep the government open and functioning,"" Senator Marsha Blackburn told Fox Business News.Appealing to those conservatives' eagerness for conducting investigations into Biden and some other top administration officials, Blackburn added: ""If you shut down the government you can't continue that.""",https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-shutdown/republicans-appeal-to-far-right-conservatives-to-avert-us-government-shutdown-idUSKBN30U0AV,reuters,2023-09-22,"['republican', 'appeal', 'far',

At present the North Korea flag is flying and we will look into it and see what the future says.""Let me tell you, our intention is that everyone should participate and everyone should have the opportunity to participate.""And if there are certain issues that happen through this pandemic and that period, so we should consider that, take it into account.""WADA said North Korea was still non-compliant with its anti-doping code and the OCA had failed to enforce its sanction.""As such after the opening ceremony, WADA wrote to the OCA to remind them of their obligations and to inform them that a compliance procedure would be opened against them as appropriate,"" the anti-doping body said in a statement.The Hangzhou Asian Games is the first international multi-sport event North Korea is attending since the 2018 edition in Jakarta.North Korea was suspended from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) until the end of 2022, missing last year's Beijing Winter Games, after failing to send a team to the Summer Olympics in Tokyo.The Asian Games was originally due to host up to 500 athletes from Russia and Belarus, despite widespread competition bans for the countries' athletes following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"".However, the IOC confirmed in the lead-up to Hangzhou that they would not participate due to ""logistical"" issues.Singh said the athletes would have ""otherwise been most welcome"" and left the door open for them to participate at future Asian competitions.",https://www.reuters.com/article/games-asia-northkorea/games-asia-olympic-body-backs-north-korea-flag-at-hangzhou-despite-wada-ban-idUSKBN30U04F,reuters,2023-09-22,"['asia', 'olympic', 'body', 'back', 'north', 'korea', 'flag', 'hangzhou', 'despite', 'wada', 'ban', 'reuters', 'the', 'olympic', 'council', 'asia', 'oca', 'say', 'happy', 'north', 'korea', 'flag', 'keep', 'fly', 'hangzhou', 'asian', 'game', 'despite', 'ban', 'country', 'global', 'world', 'agency', 'wada', 'ban', 'flag', 'major', 'sport', 'event', 'outside', 'olympic', 'paralympic', 'game', 'deem', 'north', 'korea', 'fail', 'implement', 'effective', 'test', 'north', 'korean', 'athlete', 'march', 'proudly', 'behind', 'flag', 'saturday', 'opening', 'ceremony', 'hangzhou', 'display', 'competition', 'athlete', 'oca', 'president', 'randhir', 'singh', 'say', 'asian', 'game', 'organiser', 'north', 'korea', 'discussion', 'wada', 'flag', 'still', 'fly', 'north', 'korea', 'also', 'write', 'wada', 'well', 'explain', 'position', 'tell', 'reporter', 'sunday', 'we', 'explain', 'side', 'well', 'at', 'present', 'north', 'korea', 'flag', 'fly', 'look', 'see', 'future', 'say', 'let', 'tell', 'intention', 'everyone', 'participate', 'everyone', 'opportunity', 'participate', 'and', 'certain', 'issue', 'happen', 'pandemic', 'period', 'consider', 'take', 'account', 'wada', 'say', 'north', 'korea', 'still', 'code', 'oca', 'fail', 'enforce', 'sanction', 'a', 'opening', 'ceremony', 'wada', 'write', 'oca', 'remind', 'obligation', 'inform', 'compliance', 'procedure', 'would', 'open', 'appropriate', 'body', 'say', 'hangzhou', 'asian', 'game', 'first', 'international', 'event', 'north', 'korea', 'attend', 'since', 'edition', 'korea', 'suspend', 'international', 'olympic', 'committee', 'ioc', 'end', 'miss', 'last', 'year', 'beijing', 'winter', 'game', 'fail', 'send', 'team', 'summer', 'olympics', 'asian', 'game', 'originally', 'due', 'host', 'athlete', 'russia', 'belarus', 'despite', 'widespread', 'competition', 'ban', 'country', 'athlete', 'follow', 'russia', 'invasion', 'ukraine', 'moscow', 'call', 'special', 'military', 'operation', 'ioc', 'confirm', 'hangzhou', 'would', 'participate', 'due', 'logistical', 'say', 'athlete', 'would', 'otherwise', 'welcome', 'left', 'door', 'open', 'participate', 'future', 'asian', 'competition']"

Half of the Senate's 348 seats were being contested.Le Pen's Rassemblement National had been widely expected to make a new breakthrough in the Senate but the score of three wins was above expectations.The election of far-right senators is mostly a delayed reflection of strong results by Le Pen's party in previous local elections and does not necessarily predict her results in the next elections.The only member of the French government running in the elections, Secretary of State for Citizenship Sonia Backes, was defeated in the French territory of New Caledonia.Under France's Fifth Republic, the Senate has less influence over legislating than the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament.

173,Explainer: Why Kosovo's stand-off with Serbs goes on 15 years after statehood | Reuters,2023-09-24 13:57:00-04:00,") - The storming of a north Kosovo monastery has thrown attention on persistent trouble in the ethnic Serbian-majority region 15 years after Pristina declared independence.Here are facts about the unrest.Independence for ethnic Albanian-majority Kosovo came on Feb. 17, 2008, almost a decade after a guerrilla uprising against repressive Serbian rule.It is recognised by more than 100 countries.Serbia, however, still formally deems Kosovo to be part of its territory. It accuses Kosovo's central government of trampling on the rights of ethnic Serbs but denies accusations of whipping up strife within its neighbour's borders.Serbs account for 5% of Kosovo's 1.8 million people, and ethnic Albanians about 90%. Some 50,000 Serbs in north Kosovo, on the border with Serbia, vent their rejectionism by refusing to pay the state utility for energy they use and often attacking police who try to make arrests.All of them receive benefits from Serbia's budget and pay no taxes either to Pristina or Belgrade.Unrest in the region intensified when ethnic Albanian mayors took office in northern Kosovo's Serb-majority area after April elections the Serbs boycotted, a move that led the U.S. and its allies to rebuke Pristina.Last December, North Kosovo Serbs erected multiple roadblocks and exchanged fire with police after a former Serb policeman was arrested for allegedly assaulting serving police officers during a previous protest.But tensions had been ticking upward for months in a dispute over car license plates. Kosovo has for years wanted Serbs in the north to switch their Serbian license plates, dating to the pre-independence era, to ones issued by Pristina, as part of its policy to assert authority over all of Kosovo territory.Last July, Pristina announced a two-month window for the plates to be switched over, triggering unrest, but later agreed to push the implementation date back to the end of 2023.Ethnic Serb mayors in northern municipalities, along with local judges and 600 police officers, resigned in November last year in protest at the looming switch, deepening dysfunction and lawlessness in the region.Serbs in Kosovo seek to create an association of majority-Serb municipalities operating with considerable autonomy.Pristina rejects this as a recipe for a mini-state within Kosovo, effectively partitioning the country along ethnic lines.Serbia and Kosovo have made little progress on this and other issues since committing in 2013 to a European Union-sponsored dialogue aimed at normalising ties - for both a requirement for EU membership.The transatlantic NATO military alliance retains 3,700 peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, the remainder of an original 50,000-strong force deployed in 1999.The alliance says it would intervene in line with its mandate if Kosovo were at risk of renewed conflict. The EU's EULEX mission, begun in 2008 to train domestic police and crack down on graft and gangsterism, retains 200 special police officers in Kosovo.U.S. and EU envoys are pressing Serbia and Kosovo to approve a plan presented in mid-2022 under which Belgrade would stop lobbying against a Kosovo seat in international organisations including the United Nations.Kosovo would commit to form an association of Serb-majority municipalities. And both sides would open representative offices in each other's capital to help resolve outstanding disputes.But talks on normalising relations between the two former wartime foes stalled last week, with the EU blaming Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti for failing to set up the association of municipalities.Kurti, who had agreed such an association should have only limited powers whose decisions could be overruled by central government, accused the EU mediator of siding with Serbia to pressure him to implement only one part of the deal.Serbia's president appears ready to approve the plan, warning recalcitrant nationalists in parliament that Belgrade will otherwise face damaging isolation in Europe.But with nationalist hardliners powerful on both sides, not least among north Kosovo Serbs, no breakthrough is on the horizon.The area of north Kosovo where Serbs form a majority is in important ways a virtual extension of Serbia. Local administration and public servants, teachers, doctors and big infrastructure projects are paid for by Belgrade.Local Serbs fear that once fully integrated within Kosovo they could lose benefits such as Serbia's free public healthcare and be forced onto Kosovo's private healthcare system.They also fear pensions would be smaller, given that the average monthly pension in Kosovo is worth 100 euros ($107)compared with 270 euros in Serbia.($1 = 0.9388 euros)",https://www.reuters.com/article/kosovo-serbs/explainer-why-kosovos-stand-off-with-serbs-goes-on-15-years-after-statehood-idUSKBN30U0A8,reuters,2023-09-22,"['explainer', 'why', 'kosovo', 'serb', 'go', 'year', 'statehood', 'reuters', 'the', 'storm', 'north', 'kosovo', 'monastery', 'thrown', 'attention', 'persistent', 'trouble', 'ethnic', 'region', 'year', 'pristina', 'declare', 'fact', 'ethnic', 'kosovo', 'come', 'almost', 'decade', 'guerrilla', 'uprise', 'repressive', 'serbian', 'recognise', 'however', 'still', 'formally', 'deem', 'kosovo', 'part', 'territory', 'it', 'accuse', 'kosovo', 'central', 'government', 'trample', 'right', 'ethnic', 'serb', 'deny', 'accusation', 'whip', 'strife', 'within', 'neighbour', 'account', 'kosovo', 'million', 'people', 'ethnic', 'albanian', 'some', 'serb', 'north', 'kosovo', 'border', 'serbia', 'vent', 'rejectionism', 'refuse', 'pay', 'state', 'utility', 'energy', 'use', 'often', 'attack', 'police', 'try', 'make', 'receive', 'benefit', 'serbia', 'budget', 'pay', 'tax', 'either', 'pristina', 'region', 'intensify', 'ethnic', 'albanian', 'mayor', 'take', 'office', 'northern', 'kosovo', 'area', 'april', 'election', 'serb', 'boycott', 'move', 'lead', 'ally', 'rebuke', 'december', 'north', 'kosovo', 'serb', 'erect', 'multiple', 'roadblock', 'exchange', 'fire', 'police', 'former', 'serb', 'policeman', 'arrest', 'allegedly', 'assault', 'serve', 'police', 'officer', 'previous', 'tension', 'tick', 'upward', 'month', 'dispute', 'car', 'license', 'plat', 'kosovo', 'year', 'want', 'serb', 'north', 'switch', 'serbian', 'license', 'plat', 'date', 'era', 'one', 'issue', 'pristina', 'part', 'policy', 'assert', 'authority', 'kosovo', 'july', 'pristina', 'announce', 'window', 'plate', 'switch', 'trigger', 'unrest', 'later', 'agree', 'push', 'implementation', 'date', 'back', 'end', 'serb', 'mayor', 'northern', 'municipality', 'along', 'local', 'judge', 'police', 'officer', 'resign', 'november', 'last', 'year', 'protest', 'loom', 'switch', 'deepen', 'dysfunction', 'lawlessness', 'kosovo', 'seek', 'create', 'association', 'municipality', 'operate', 'considerable', 'reject', 'recipe', 'within', 'kosovo', 'effectively', 'partition', 'country', 'along', 'ethnic', 'kosovo', 'make', 'little', 'progress', 'issue', 'since', 'commit', 'european', 'dialogue', 'aim', 'normalising', 'tie', 'requirement', 'eu', 'transatlantic', 'nato', 'military', 'alliance', 'retains', 'peacekeeping', 'troop', 'kosovo', 'remainder', 'original', 'force', 'deploy', 'alliance', 'say', 'would', 'intervene', 'line', 'mandate', 'kosovo', 'risk', 'renew', 'conflict', 'the', 'eu', 'eulex', 'mission', 'begin', 'train', 'domestic', 'police', 'crack', 'graft', 'gangsterism', 'retain', 'special', 'police', 'officer', 'eu', 'envoys', 'press', 'serbia', 'kosovo', 'approve', 'plan', 'present', 'belgrade', 'would', 'stop', 'lobbying', 'kosovo', 'seat', 'international', 'organisation', 'include', 'united', 'would', 'commit', 'form', 'association', 'municipality', 'and', 'side', 'would', 'open', 'representative', 'office', 'capital', 'help', 'resolve', 'outstanding', 'talk', 'normalise', 'relation', 'two', 'former', 'wartime', 'foe', 'stall', 'last', 'week', 'eu', 'blaming', 'kosovo', 'prime', 'minister', 'albin', 'kurti', 'fail', 'set', 'association', 'agree', 'association', 'limit', 'power', 'whose', 'decision', 'could', 'overrule', 'central', 'government', 'accuse', 'eu', 'mediator', 'side', 'serbia', 'pressure', 'implement', 'one', 'part', 'president', 'appear', 'ready', 'approve', 'plan', 'warn', 'recalcitrant', 'nationalist', 'parliament', 'belgrade', 'otherwise', 'face', 'damage', 'isolation', 'nationalist', 'hardliner', 'powerful', 'side', 'least', 'among', 'north', 'kosovo', 'serb', 'breakthrough', 'area', 'north', 'kosovo', 'serb', 'form', 'majority', 'important', 'way', 'virtual', 'extension', 'serbia', 'local', 'administration', 'public', 'servants', 'teacher', 'doctor', 'big', 'infrastructure', 'project', 'pay', 'serb', 'fear', 'fully', 'integrate', 'within', 'kosovo', 'could', 'lose', 'benefit', 'serbia', 'free', 'public', 'healthcare', 'force', 'onto', 'kosovo', 'private', 'healthcare', 'also', 'fear', 'pension', 'would', 'small', 'give', 'average', 'monthly', 'pension', 'kosovo', 'worth', 'euro', 'compare', 'euro', 'serbia', 'euro']"
174,"Taiwan expects to deploy two new submarines by 2027, security adviser says | Reuters",2023-09-24 20:03:00-04:00,") - Taiwan hopes to deploy at least two new, domestically developed submarines by 2027, and possibly equip later models with missiles, to strengthen deterrence against the Chinese navy and protect key supply lines, the head of the program said.Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has made the indigenous sub program a key part of an ambitious project to modernise its armed forces as Beijing stages almost daily military exercises to assert its sovereignty.President Tsai Ing-wen, who initiated the program when she took office in 2016, is expected to launch the first of eight new submarines on Thursday under a plan that has drawn on expertise and technology from several countries - a breakthrough for diplomatically isolated Taiwan.Admiral Huang Shu-kuang, Tsai's security adviser, who is leading the program, said a fleet of 10 submarines - which includes two Dutch-made submarines commissioned in the 1980s - will make it harder for the Chinese navy to project power into the Pacific.""If we can build up this combat capacity, I don't think we will lose a war,"" Huang this month told an internal briefing on the project, which was attended by Reuters.Huang said the first submarine, with a price tag of T$49.36 billion ($1.54 billion), will use a combat system by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and carry U.S.-made MK-48 heavyweight torpedoes. It will enter sea trials next month before delivery to the navy by the end of 2024.For subsequent models, Taiwan will leave space for submarine-launched anti-ship missiles, but adding those weapons depends on production availability in a U.S., where capacity was already tight, Huang said, without naming the companies that might be involved.He called the submarines a ""strategic deterrent"" to Chinese warships crossing the Miyako Strait near southwestern Japan or the Bashi Channel that separates Taiwan from the Philippines.Huang said Taiwan's diesel-electric submarines can keep China at bay within the first island chain, referring to the area that runs from Japan through Taiwan, the Philippines and on to Borneo, enclosing China's coastal seas.""This was also the strategic concept of the U.S. military - to contain them within the first island chain and deny their access,"" Huang said. ""If Taiwan is taken, Japan will definitely not be safe, South Korea will definitely not be safe.""China's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment.The Chinese navy, including its Shandong aircraft carrier, has become increasingly active in recent months off Taiwan's eastern coastline, prompting worries that China could launch an attack from that direction. Eastern Taiwan is where planners have long envisioned the island's military regrouping and preserving its forces during a conflict.Huang said the submarines can help maintain the island's ""lifeline"" to the Pacific by keeping ports along Taiwan's eastern coast open for supplies in a conflict.""The submarines will keep their ships away from our eastern shores,"" he said.Chieh Chung, a military researcher at Taiwan's National Policy Foundation think tank, said the fleet would have trouble with that task, because China could position warships in the Pacific before launching an attack.But he added that the submarines could occupy strategic ambush points in the region and ""greatly harm (China's) combat ability"" by targeting high-value ships such as carrier groups or landing fleets.Taiwan has quietly sourced technology, components and talent from at least seven nations to help it build submarines, a Reuters investigation has found.Getting foreign assistance was particularly challenging for Taiwan, which doesn't have official ties with most countries.Huang declined to say which countries had approved export permits, but said he had reached out to generals from countries that included the United States, Japan, South Korea and India.""For those foreign generals who agreed with my ideas, they helped convey the message to their governments or arrange meetings,"" he said. ""I told them our needs and that's how we achieved our purpose of securing export permits.""Huang also expressed thanks for the ""great help"" from a team led by an unnamed retired rear admiral of Britain's Royal Navy, who secured export permits from Britain through a Gibraltar-based company.Britain sharply increased the amount of submarine parts and technology exports approved last year for Taiwan, a Reuters analysis of the data showed.Huang described the program as ""even harder than reaching the sky,"" pointing to challenges such as a global chip shortage that hit many manufacturers around the world. He said his team scrambled to source chips from Taiwan to avoid delays by foreign vendors.A foreign supplier had also pull out at the last minute after the work with Taiwan was leaked to a Chinese embassy, he said, without elaborating.He said China's frequent military harassment, including close approaches to Taiwan's territorial waters and airspace, has prompted Taiwan and the United States to rethink the island's ""asymmetrical"" strategy of making its forces more mobile and harder to attack, with a focus on smaller weapons systems.""The American thinking is changing gradually. They realised that you can't withstand (the harassment) without bigger boats,"" Huang said, pointing to the navy's plan to build a new generation of bigger frigates.""They are getting closer and closer,"" he added, referring to China. ""Taiwan can't drive them out with small boats. We must use bigger boats.""($1 = 31.9840 Taiwan

175,Canada House speaker apologizes for recognition of veteran who fought for Nazis | Reuters,2023-09-24 20:49:00-04:00,") - The speaker of Canada's House of Commons on Sunday apologized for praising an individual at a parliamentary meeting who served in a Nazi unit during World War Two.Two days earlier, Speaker Anthony Rota had recognized 98-year old Yaroslav Hunka as a ""Ukrainian hero"" before the Canadian Parliament. Hunka served in World War II as a member of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, according to the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights group that demanded an apology.Rota in a statement took responsibility for what was characterized as an oversight, calling the initiative ""entirely my own.""""I have subsequently become aware of more information which causes me to regret my decision,"" he said, adding his ""deepest apologies"" to Jewish communities.The recognition came following a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who thanked Canada for its assistance in his country's war against Russia.Following Zelenskiy's remarks, Rota acknowledged Hunka, who was seated in the gallery, praising him for fighting for Ukrainian independence against the Russians. Hunka received two standing ovations from those gathered.""At a time of rising antisemitism and Holocaust distortion, it is incredibly disturbing to see Canada's Parliament rise to applaud an individual who was a member of a unit in the Waffen-SS, a Nazi military branch responsible for the murder of Jews and others,"" the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center said in a statement while demanding an apology earlier Sunday.""An explanation must be provided as to how this individual entered the hallowed halls of Canadian Parliament and received recognition from the Speaker of the House and a standing ovation,"" the group added.Russia's RIA state news agency cited Russia's ambassador to Canada, Oleg Stepanov, as saying that the embassy will sent a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and a note to the Canadian foreign ministry on Monday.""We will, of course, demand clarification from the Canadian government,"" RIA cited Stepanov as saying.Russia launched a full-scale invasion on Ukraine in February 2022, saying the goal of the ""special military operation"" was to de-nazify and demilitarize its neighbour.Kyiv and its Western allies, say the aggression, which has since seen thousands killed and millions displaced, has been an unprovoked land grab. Washington has said that Moscow's false justification for the war has been nothing but the Kremlin's attempt to ""manipulate international public opinion.""Rota added in his statement that no one, including fellow parliamentarians or the Ukrainian delegation, was aware of his plans or remarks beforehand.Hunka could not be reached for comment.",https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-canada-zelenskiy/canada-house-speaker-apologizes-for-recognition-of-veteran-who-fought-for-nazis-idUSKBN30U0GX,reuters,2023-09-22,"['canada', 'house', 'speaker', 'apologize', 'recognition', 'veteran', 'fight', 'nazi', 'reuters', 'the', 'speaker', 'canada', 'house', 'common', 'sunday', 'apologize', 'praise', 'individual', 'parliamentary', 'meeting', 'serve', 'nazi', 'unit', 'world', 'war', 'day', 'earlier', 'speaker', 'anthony', 'rota', 'recognize', 'old', 'yaroslav', 'hunka', 'ukrainian', 'hero', 'canadian', 'parliament', 'hunka', 'serve', 'world', 'war', 'ii', 'member', 'waffen', 'grenadier', 'division', 's', 'accord', 'friend', 'simon', 'wiesenthal', 'center', 'jewish', 'human', 'right', 'group', 'demand', 'statement', 'take', 'responsibility', 'characterize', 'oversight', 'call', 'initiative', 'entirely', 'i', 'subsequently', 'become', 'aware', 'information', 'cause', 'regret', 'decision', 'say', 'add', 'deepest', 'apology', 'jewish', 'recognition', 'come', 'follow', 'visit', 'ukrainian', 'president', 'volodymyr', 'zelenskiy', 'thank', 'canada', 'assistance', 'country', 'war', 'zelenskiy', 'remark', 'rota', 'acknowledge', 'hunka', 'seat', 'gallery', 'praise', 'fight', 'ukrainian', 'independence', 'russian', 'hunka', 'receive', 'two', 'stand', 'ovation', 'gather', 'at', 'time', 'rise', 'antisemitism', 'holocaust', 'distortion', 'incredibly', 'disturb', 'see', 'canada', 'parliament', 'rise', 'applaud', 'individual', 'member', 'unit', 'nazi', 'military', 'branch', 'responsible', 'murder', 'jew', 'others', 'friend', 'simon', 'wiesenthal', 'center', 'say', 'statement', 'demand', 'apology', 'earlier', 'sunday', 'an', 'explanation', 'must', 'provide', 'individual', 'enter', 'hallowed', 'hall', 'canadian', 'parliament', 'receive', 'recognition', 'speaker', 'house', 'stand', 'ovation', 'group', 'ria', 'state', 'news', 'agency', 'cite', 'russia', 'ambassador', 'canada', 'oleg', 'stepanov', 'say', 'embassy', 'sent', 'letter', 'prime', 'minister', 'justin', 'trudeau', 'note', 'canadian', 'foreign', 'ministry', 'monday', 'we', 'course', 'demand', 'clarification', 'canadian', 'government', 'ria', 'cite', 'stepanov', 'launch', 'invasion', 'ukraine', 'february', 'say', 'goal', 'special', 'military', 'operation', 'demilitarize', 'western', 'ally', 'say', 'aggression', 'since', 'see', 'thousand', 'kill', 'million', 'displace', 'unprovoked', 'land', 'grab', 'washington', 'say', 'moscow', 'false', 'justification', 'war', 'nothing', 'kremlin', 'attempt', 'manipulate', 'international', 'public', 'opinion', 'rota', 'add', 'statement', 'one', 'include', 'fellow', 'parliamentarian', 'ukrainian', 'delegation', 'aware', 'plan', 'remark', 'could', 'reach', 'comment']"

177,Capsule with NASA's first asteroid sample heads for Utah touchdown | Reuters,2023-09-24 11:20:00-04:00,") - A NASA capsule carrying the largest soil sample ever collected from an asteroid is due to return to Earth on Sunday, expected to streak through the atmosphere and parachute into the Utah desert to deliver its celestial specimen to scientists.The robotic spacecraft OSIRIS-REx is scheduled to release the gumdrop-shaped capsule, transporting about a cup of gravelly asteroid material, at 6:42 a.m. EDT (1042 GMT) for a final descent to Earth, climaxing a seven-year voyage.Plans call for the capsule to touch down a little more than four hours later within a 250-square-mile (650-sq-km) landing zone west of Salt Lake City on the U.S. military's vast Utah Test and Training Range.Success of the mission, a joint effort between NASA and the University of Arizona, would mark the third asteroid sample, and by far the biggest, ever returned to Earth for analysis, following two similar missions by Japan's space agency ending in 2010 and 2020.OSIRIS-REx collected its specimen from Bennu, a small, carbon-rich asteroid discovered in 1999 and classified as a ""near-Earth object"" because it passes relatively close to our planet every six years, though the odds of an impact are considered remote.Apparently made up of a loose collection of rocks, like a rubble pile, Bennu measures just 500 meters (1,600 ft) across, making it slightly wider than the Empire State Building is tall but tiny compared with the Chicxulub asteroid that struck Earth some 66 million years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs.Like other asteroids, Bennu is a relic of the early solar system. Because its present-day chemistry and mineralogy are virtually unchanged since forming some 4.5 billion years ago, it holds valuable clues to the origins and development of rocky planets such as Earth.It may even contain organic molecules similar to those necessary for the emergence of microbes.Samples returned three years ago by the Japanese mission Hayabusa2 from Ryugu, another near-Earth asteroid, were found to contain two organic compounds, buttressing the hypothesis that celestial objects such as comets, asteroids and meteorites that bombarded early Earth seeded the young planet with the primordial ingredients for life.OSIRIS-REx launched in September 2016 and reached Bennu in 2018, then spent nearly two years orbiting the asteroid before venturing close enough to snatch a sample of the loose surface material with its robot arm on Oct. 20, 2020.The spacecraft departed Bennu in May 2021 for a 1.2-billion-mile (1.9-billion-km) cruise back to Earth, including two orbits around the sun. If mission control commands the release of the sample-return capsule as planned, it will be jettisoned within 67,000 miles of Earth for the final leg of its return flight.Hitting the upper atmosphere at 35 times the speed of sound, the capsule is expected to glow red hot as it plunges earthward and temperatures inside the vessel peak at 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,800°C).Parachutes are designed to deploy near the very end of the descent, slowing the capsule to about 11 mph before it falls gently onto the desert floor of northwestern Utah.The Bennu sample is estimated at 250 grams (8.8 ounces), far surpassing the 5 grams of material carried back from Ryugu in 2020 or the tiny specimen delivered from asteroid Itokawa in 2010.Scientists hope the integrity of the capsule and inner cannister bearing the asteroid material will be maintained through re-entry and landing, keeping the sample pristine and free of any terrestrial contamination.On arrival, the sample will be flown by helicopter to a ""clean room"" at the Utah test range for initial examination, then transported to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, to be parceled into smaller specimens promised to some 200 scientists in 60 laboratories around the world.The main portion of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, meanwhile, is expected to sail on to explore yet another near-Earth asteroid, named Apophis.",https://www.reuters.com/article/space-exploration-asteroid/nasa-asteroid-sample-parachutes-safely-onto-utah-desert-idUSKBN30U01Y,reuters,2023-09-22,"['capsule', 'nasa', 'first', 'asteroid', 'sample', 'head', 'utah', 'touchdown', 'reuters', 'a', 'nasa', 'capsule', 'carry', 'large', 'soil', 'sample', 'ever', 'collect', 'asteroid', 'due', 'return', 'earth', 'sunday', 'expect', 'streak', 'atmosphere', 'parachute', 'utah', 'desert', 'deliver', 'celestial', 'specimen', 'robotic', 'spacecraft', 'schedule', 'release', 'capsule', 'transport', 'cup', 'gravelly', 'asteroid', 'material', 'edt', 'gmt', 'final', 'descent', 'earth', 'climax', 'call', 'capsule', 'touch', 'little', 'four', 'hour', 'later', 'within', 'land', 'zone', 'west', 'salt', 'lake', 'city', 'military', 'vast', 'utah', 'test', 'training', 'mission', 'joint', 'effort', 'nasa', 'university', 'arizona', 'would', 'mark', 'third', 'asteroid', 'sample', 'far', 'big', 'ever', 'return', 'earth', 'analysis', 'follow', 'two', 'similar', 'mission', 'japan', 'space', 'agency', 'end', 'collect', 'specimen', 'bennu', 'small', 'asteroid', 'discover', 'classified', 'object', 'pass', 'relatively', 'close', 'planet', 'every', 'six', 'year', 'though', 'odds', 'impact', 'consider', 'make', 'loose', 'collection', 'rock', 'like', 'rubble', 'pile', 'bennu', 'measure', 'meter', 'ft', 'across', 'make', 'slightly', 'wide', 'empire', 'state', 'building', 'tall', 'tiny', 'compare', 'chicxulub', 'asteroid', 'strike', 'earth', 'million', 'year', 'ago', 'wipe', 'asteroid', 'bennu', 'relic', 'early', 'solar', 'system', 'because', 'chemistry', 'mineralogy', 'virtually', 'unchanged', 'since', 'form', 'billion', 'year', 'ago', 'hold', 'valuable', 'clue', 'origins', 'development', 'rocky', 'planet', 'may', 'even', 'contain', 'organic', 'molecule', 'similar', 'necessary', 'emergence', 'return', 'three', 'year', 'ago', 'japanese', 'mission', 'ryugu', 'another', 'asteroid', 'find', 'contain', 'two', 'organic', 'compound', 'buttress', 'hypothesis', 'celestial', 'object', 'comet', 'asteroids', 'meteorite', 'bombard', 'early', 'earth', 'seed', 'young', 'planet', 'primordial', 'ingredient', 'launch', 'september', 'reach', 'bennu', 'spend', 'nearly', 'two', 'year', 'orbit', 'asteroid', 'venture', 'close', 'enough', 'snatch', 'sample', 'loose', 'surface', 'material', 'robot', 'arm', 'spacecraft', 'depart', 'bennu', 'may', 'cruise', 'back', 'earth', 'include', 'two', 'orbit', 'around', 'sun', 'if', 'mission', 'control', 'command', 'release', 'capsule', 'plan', 'jettison', 'within', 'mile', 'earth', 'final', 'leg', 'return', 'upper', 'atmosphere', 'time', 'speed', 'sound', 'capsule', 'expect', 'glow', 'red', 'hot', 'plunge', 'earthward', 'temperature', 'inside', 'vessel', 'peak', 'degree', 'fahrenheit', 'design', 'deploy', 'near', 'end', 'descent', 'slow', 'capsule', 'mph', 'fall', 'gently', 'onto', 'desert', 'floor', 'northwestern', 'bennu', 'sample', 'estimate', 'gram', 'ounce', 'far', 'surpass', 'grams', 'material', 'carry', 'back', 'ryugu', 'tiny', 'specimen', 'deliver', 'asteroid', 'itokawa', 'hope', 'integrity', 'capsule', 'inner', 'cannister', 'bear', 'asteroid', 'material', 'maintain', 'land', 'keep', 'sample', 'pristine', 'free', 'terrestrial', 'arrival', 'sample', 'flown', 'helicopter', 'clean', 'room', 'utah', 'test', 'range', 'initial', 'examination', 'transport', 'nasa', 'johnson', 'space', 'center', 'houston', 'parcel', 'small', 'specimen', 'promise', 'scientist', 'laboratory', 'around', 'main', 'portion', 'spacecraft', 'meanwhile', 'expect', 'sail', 'explore', 'yet', 'another', 'asteroid', 'name', 'apophis']"
178,Serb gunmen battle police in Kosovo monastery siege; four dead | Reuters,2023-09-24 16:38:00-04:00,") - Ethnic Serb gunmen in armoured vehicles stormed a village in north Kosovo on Sunday, battling police and barricading themselves in a monastery in a resurgence of violence in the restive north that killed four people.The siege centred on a Serbian Orthodox monastery near the village of Banjska in the Serb-majority region where monks and pilgrims hid inside a temple as a shootout raged.One police officer and three of the attackers died, according to authorities in Kosovo and Serbia.Ethnic Albanians form the vast majority of the 1.8 million population of Kosovo, a former province of Serbia.But some 50,000 Serbs in the north have never accepted Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence and still see Belgrade as their capital, more than two decades after a Kosovo Albanian guerrilla uprising against repressive Serbian rule.A group of Kosovo Serbs positioned trucks on a bridge into the village, shooting at police who approached them, before the battle moved to the nearby monastery, according to accounts by both Kosovo police and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.The gunmen had left the monastery by night, the Serbian Orthodox Church said, though it was unclear where they went.Vucic said the action was a rebellion against Kurti, who has refused to form an association of Serb municipalities in north Kosovo. ""Serbia will never recognise independent Kosovo, you can kill us all,"" he said.Two Serbs were seriously injured and a fourth among them may have died, Vucic said. He condemned the killing of the police officer and urged restraint from Kosovo Serbs.The Serbian Orthodox Church's diocese of Raska-Prizren, which includes Banjska, said men in an armoured vehicle entered the monastery compound, forcing monks and visiting faithful to lock themselves inside the temple.The Kosovo police later said they had entered the monastery and were checking for possible infiltrators among worshippers. Three of their personnel were also injured, as well as the fatality in their ranks, police said.Kosovo's Interior Minister Xhelal Svecla said police found a large number of heavy weapons, explosives and uniforms ""that were enough for hundreds of other attackers"", indicating preparations for a massive assault.The head of the U.N. mission in Kosovo, Caroline Ziadeh, and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell condemned the violence.Borrell talked with both Kurti and Vucic, according to his office.NATO troops, along with members of the EU police force EULEX and Kosovo police, could be seen patrolling the road leading to Banjska, according to a Reuters reporter nearby.Kosovo border police closed two crossings with Serbia.Serbs in north Kosovo have long demanded the implementation of a EU-brokered 2013 deal for the creation of an association of autonomous municipalities in their area.EU-sponsored talks on normalising relations between Serbia and Kosovo stalled last week, with the bloc blaming Kurti for failing to set up the association.Pristina sees the plan as a recipe for a mini-state within Kosovo, effectively partitioning the country along ethnic lines.Serbia still formally deems Kosovo to be part of its territory, but denies suggestions of whipping up strife within its neighbour's borders. Belgrade accuses Pristina of trampling on the rights of minority Serbs.Unrest intensified when ethnic Albanian mayors took office in north Kosovo after April elections the Serbs boycotted.Clashes in May injured dozens of protesters and NATO alliance peacekeepers.NATO retains 3,700 troops in Kosovo, the remainder of an original 50,000-strong force deployed in 1999.The area of north Kosovo where Serbs form a majority is in important ways a virtual extension of Serbia.

180,"Polls show Australia Indigenous referendum support slipping, likely to fail | Reuters",2023-09-24 19:39:00-04:00,") - Support for a referendum to constitutionally recognise Australia's Indigenous people slipped further, with the landmark proposal set to fail in a national vote roughly three weeks away, two opinion polls showed on Monday.Support for a ""Voice to Parliament"", an Indigenous committee to advise parliament on matters affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people, fell to 33%, down 15 points since May, the Australian Financial Review (AFR)/Freshwater poll showed. The 'No' vote had reached 50%.Despite the Anthony Albanese-led Labor government's campaign drive to win undecided voters, opposition to the referendum rose three points to 56%, a Newspoll conducted for The Australian newspaper showed. Support dipped to 36% from 38% in the previous poll on Sept. 3.Altering the constitution requires a national referendum in Australia and only eight have passed since 1901 when the country was formed. The proposal must get a majority of votes nationwide and at least four of the six states must back the change.Australia, which will hold the referendum vote on Oct. 14, has no treaty with its Indigenous people, who make up about 3.2% of its 26 million population. They were marginalised by British colonial rulers and are not mentioned in the 122-year-old constitution.The referendum debate has divided opinions with supporters arguing the Voice will bring progress for the Aboriginal community, while opponents say it would be divisive. Others have described it as tokenism and toothless.Voters who had switched their stance to reject the proposal in the past five months said the Voice was creating distraction from their top two issues - the cost of living and the cost of housing, the AFR survey said.It also showed the approval ratings for Albanese, who has staked significant political capital on the referendum, fell 5 points to 46%.In the Newspoll survey, Albanese's ratings improved slightly to 47% though that remained at historically low levels, while on a two-party preferred basis, Labor enjoyed a 54-46% lead against the conservative opposition coalition.",https://www.reuters.com/article/australia-indigenous/polls-show-australia-indigenous-referendum-support-slipping-likely-to-fail-idUSKBN30U0GZ,reuters,2023-09-22,"['poll', 'show', 'australia', 'indigenous', 'referendum', 'support', 'slip', 'likely', 'fail', 'reuters', 'support', 'referendum', 'constitutionally', 'recognise', 'australia', 'indigenous', 'people', 'slip', 'landmark', 'proposal', 'set', 'fail', 'national', 'vote', 'roughly', 'three', 'week', 'away', 'two', 'opinion', 'poll', 'show', 'voice', 'parliament', 'indigenous', 'committee', 'advise', 'parliament', 'matter', 'affect', 'aboriginal', 'torres', 'strait', 'island', 'people', 'fell', 'point', 'since', 'may', 'australian', 'financial', 'review', 'afr', 'poll', 'show', 'the', 'vote', 'reach', 'anthony', 'labor', 'government', 'campaign', 'drive', 'win', 'undecided', 'voter', 'opposition', 'referendum', 'rise', 'three', 'point', 'newspoll', 'conduct', 'the', 'australian', 'newspaper', 'show', 'support', 'dip', 'previous', 'poll', 'constitution', 'require', 'national', 'referendum', 'australia', 'eight', 'pass', 'since', 'country', 'form', 'the', 'proposal', 'must', 'get', 'majority', 'vote', 'nationwide', 'least', 'four', 'six', 'state', 'must', 'back', 'hold', 'referendum', 'vote', 'treaty', 'indigenous', 'people', 'make', 'million', 'population', 'they', 'marginalise', 'british', 'colonial', 'ruler', 'mention', 'referendum', 'debate', 'divide', 'opinion', 'supporter', 'argue', 'voice', 'bring', 'progress', 'aboriginal', 'community', 'opponent', 'say', 'would', 'divisive', 'others', 'described', 'tokenism', 'switch', 'stance', 'reject', 'proposal', 'past', 'five', 'month', 'say', 'voice', 'create', 'distraction', 'top', 'two', 'issue', 'cost', 'living', 'cost', 'housing', 'afr', 'survey', 'also', 'show', 'approval', 'rating', 'albanese', 'stake', 'significant', 'political', 'capital', 'referendum', 'fell', 'point', 'newspoll', 'survey', 'albanese', 'rating', 'improve', 'slightly', 'though', 'remain', 'historically', 'low', 'level', 'prefer', 'basis', 'labor', 'enjoy', 'lead', 'conservative', 'opposition', 'coalition']"

182,Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenians start to leave en masse for Armenia | Reuters,2023-09-24 18:39:00-04:00,") - Ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh began a mass exodus by car on Sunday toward Armenia after Azerbaijan defeated the breakaway region's fighters in a conflict dating from the Soviet era.The Nagorno-Karabakh leadership told Reuters the region's 120,000 Armenians did not want to live as part of Azerbaijan for fear of persecution and ethnic cleansing.Those with fuel had started to drive down the Lachin corridor toward the border with Armenia, according to a Reuters reporter in the Karabakh capital known as Stepanakert by Armenia and Khankendi by Azerbaijan.An Armenian government statement said 1,050 people had crossed into Armenia from Nagorno-Karabkah as of 10 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Sunday.Reuters pictures showed dozens of cars driving out of the capital toward the corridor's mountainous curves.The Armenians of Karabakh, a territory internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but previously beyond its control, were forced into a ceasefire last week after a 24-hour military operation by the much-larger Azerbaijani military.Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought two wars over the enclave in 30 years -- with Azerbaijan gaining back swathes of territory in and around Nagorno-Karabakh in a six-week conflict in 2020.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who backed the Azeris with weaponry in the 2020 conflict, was due on Monday to meet Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev in Nakhchivan -- a strip of Azeri territory nestled between Armenia, Iran and Turkey.Erdogan last week said he supported the aims of Azerbaijan's latest military operation but played no part in it.The Armenians are not accepting Azerbaijan's promise to guarantee their rights as the region is integrated.""Ninety-nine point nine percent prefer to leave our historic lands,"" David Babayan, an adviser to Samvel Shahramanyan, president of the self-styled Republic of Artsakh, told Reuters.""The fate of our poor people will go down in history as a disgrace and a shame for the Armenian people and for the whole civilised world,"" Babayan said. ""Those responsible for our fate will one day have to answer before God for their sins.""The Armenian leaders of Karabakh said that all those made homeless by the Azerbaijani military operation and wanting to leave would be escorted to Armenia by Russian peacekeepers.Reuters reporters near the village of Kornidzor on the Armenian border saw some heavily laden cars pass into Armenia. Armenia said 377 refugees had arrived by Sunday evening.Armenia Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has faced calls to resign for failing to save Karabakh. In an address to the nation, he said some aid had arrived but a mass exodus looked inevitable.""If proper conditions are not created for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their homes and there are no effective protection mechanisms against ethnic cleansing, the likelihood is rising that the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh will see exile from their homeland as the only way to save their lives and identity,"" he said, according to an official transcript.The situation could change the delicate balance of power in the South Caucasus region, a patchwork of ethnicities crisscrossed with oil and gas pipelines where Russia, the United States, Turkey and Iran vie for influence.Last week's Azerbaijani victory appears to end one of the decades-old ""frozen conflicts"" of the Soviet Union's dissolution. Aliyev said his ""iron fist"" had consigned the idea of an independent ethnic Armenian Karabakh to history and that the region would be turned into a ""paradise.""Armenia says more than 200 people were killed and 400 wounded in the Azerbaijani military operation.Nagorno-Karabakh lies in an area that over centuries has come under the sway of Persians, Turks, Russians, Ottomans and Soviets. It was claimed by both Azerbaijan and Armenia after the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917. In Soviet times it was designated an autonomous region within Azerbaijan.As the Soviet Union crumbled, the Armenians there threw off nominal Azeri control and captured neighbouring territory in what is now known as the First Karabakh War. From 1988 to 1994 about 30,000 people were killed and more than 1 million -- mostly Azeris -- displaced.In 2020, after decades of skirmishes, Azerbaijan won a decisive 44-day Second Karabakh War. That war ended with a Russian-brokered peace deal Armenians accuse Moscow of failing to guarantee.The Armenian authorities in the region on Saturday said about 150 tonnes of humanitarian cargo from Russia and another 65 tonnes of flour shipped by the International Committee of the Red Cross had arrived in the region.With 2,000 peacekeepers present, Russia said that under the terms of the ceasefire, six armoured vehicles, more than 800 small arms, anti-tank weapons and portable air defence systems, plus 22,000 ammunition rounds had been handed in by Saturday.Space for 40,000 people from Karabakh had been prepared in Armenia. Azerbaijan, which is mainly Muslim, has said that the Armenians, who are Christian, can leave if they want.Pashinyan on Sunday blamed Russia for failing to do enough for Armenia, which he said would review its alliance with Moscow.""Some of our partners are increasingly making efforts to expose our security vulnerabilities, putting at risk not only our external, but also internal, security and
